Subject: New Project: IndoTech Web Solutions Website Development

Hi Saurabh,

Hope you're doing well.

We're kicking off the development for the website of our new software venture, IndoTech Web Solutions. Richa shared the initial website blueprint via email on May 1st (Subject: "IndoTech Web Solutions Blueprint"), which outlines the structure and content. Please review it.

Your task is to develop this website. We'll be using the same technology stack as the Satyajit Rout project: Next.js, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Please ensure the development work is done on a Mac environment.

For the initial phase of development, let's plan to do the work at 67 so I can be available to help and collaborate closely as we get started.

Let me know if you have any initial questions after reviewing the blueprint.

Thanks,
Rohan
