Subject: Enduroco New Plan Page Marketing Email

Hi Richa,

We have to send an email to all enduroco users as per our weekly marketing email series.

This refers to the recently updated page on the Enduroco website/app that details the different subscription plans and their features.

The goal is to raise awareness among both current and potential users about these plans and encourage them to explore the options available.

Could you please take ownership of developing and executing a marketing strategy for this? This could involve things like social media posts, email announcements, in-app messages, or other ideas you might have.

Please let me know your initial thoughts on how we can approach this, or if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rohan
