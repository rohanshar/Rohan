Subject: Follow-up: Smart Street Light Project - Registration Status

Hi Vijay,

Hope you're doing well.

Just wanted to follow up on the registration process for the ITI Limited empanelment regarding the Smart Street Light project. Could you please provide an update on its status?

As a reminder, once the registration is complete, the next step is to inform Mr. Sindhu Gupta so he can proceed further.

Please let me know if there's anything needed from my end.

Thanks,

Rohan
