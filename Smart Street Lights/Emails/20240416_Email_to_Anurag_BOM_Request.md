Subject: Smart Street Light Project - BOM Request for Component Procurement

Hi Anurag,

Following up on the Smart Street Light project proposal document you shared, we'd like to initiate the first step: Component Procurement and Verification.

To move forward with this, could you please provide a detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) for the different components outlined in the proposal? Specifically, we need the detailed parts list for:

1.  The Street Light unit itself (including variations for different wattages like 25W to 200W, if the internal components differ significantly beyond the LED/driver).
2.  The Control Module (including any variations between the "Master" and "Slave" modules, listing all specified components like the MSP430F427, EC200U, RF module, sensors, memory, LCD, relay, power supply components like VIPER267K, etc.).

Having the complete BOM with specific part numbers, manufacturers (if specified), and quantities per unit will allow us to:

*   Check current availability and lead times with suppliers.
*   Get accurate cost estimations.
*   Place orders for the initial batches needed for prototyping and testing.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Rohan
