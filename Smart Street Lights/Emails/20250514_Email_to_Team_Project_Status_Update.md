Subject: Smart Street Light Project - Comprehensive Status Update & Pending Tasks (May 8, 2025)

Dear Team,

I wanted to provide a comprehensive update on our Smart Street Light project, summarizing the current status and listing all pending tasks by component area. Please review your assigned tasks and provide updates on any progress or blockers.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW STATUS

The project is currently in the component design and specification phase, with several parallel workstreams:

1. **Streetlight Driver** (Power Supply, Control Unit, Bluetooth RF Module)
2. **Master Driver** (Based on Smart Meter PCB)
3. **Cloud Dashboard**
4. **ITI Limited Empanelment**
5. **Component Procurement & BOM**

## PENDING TASKS BY COMPONENT

### 1. Streetlight Driver

**Power Supply:**
- **RK Sir:** Test driving the 25W streetlight using an existing SMPS. This is a critical path item as it will inform our power supply design decisions.
  - *Status: Pending*

**RF Module:**
- **Arun Sharma:** The JDY-25M Bluetooth 5.0 BLE5.0 Mesh Networking Module has been ordered and is expected to arrive by May 15th, 2025.
  - *Status: In progress - Awaiting delivery*
  - *Note: This replaces our previous consideration of the Radio Craft TM407X-000 module*

**Dimmable LED Driver:**
- **Arun Sharma:** Follow up with Digitech Lights for an improved price on "Constant voltage dimmable LED driver" (12V 60W). After getting an improved price, process order for 2 samples first.
  - *Status: Pending*
  - *Note: Bulk quote for 5000 units is on hold until we verify the samples*

### 2. Master Driver

- **Anurag:** Complete the Master Schematic after receiving the Bluetooth module.
  - *Status: Partially designed - Awaiting Bluetooth module*
  - *Dependency: JDY-25M Bluetooth module delivery*

### 3. Cloud Dashboard

- **Team:** Review initial dashboard frontend (populated with sample data) and provide feedback.
  - *Status: Frontend developed and ready for review*
  - *Note: No feedback received yet from team members*

### 4. Component Procurement & BOM

- **Anurag:** Complete BOM for Master Control Module.
  - *Status: Incomplete - Awaiting Bluetooth module specs*
  - *Dependency: JDY-25M Bluetooth module delivery*

- **Anurag:** Complete BOM for 25W Street Light.
  - *Status: Pending - Awaiting street light and driver*
  - *Dependency: Street light and driver procurement*

### 5. ITI Limited Empanelment

- **Team:** Wait for ITI Limited to process empanelment documents.
  - *Status: Documents submitted on April 29, 2025*
  - *Note: Expected 15-day processing time (response expected by May 14, 2025)*

- **Anurag:** Follow up with Mr. Sindhu Gupta (9412956000) after May 20-21 if no response received.
  - *Status: Pending - Contingent on ITI Limited response*
  - *Note: Anurag reports being in continuous contact with Mr. Gupta*

## CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

1. **Bluetooth Module Delivery** - This is blocking the Master Schematic completion and BOM finalization
2. **Street Light and Driver Testing** - Required for BOM completion and prototype development
3. **ITI Limited Empanelment** - Required for potential project deployment

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Weekly Status Updates:** Please provide weekly updates on your assigned tasks by email every Monday.
2. **Component Testing:** Once the Bluetooth module arrives, we'll schedule a technical session to test integration with our existing components.
3. **BOM Finalization:** After all components are specified, we'll finalize the BOM and begin procurement for prototype development.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any of the tasks. Your prompt attention to your assigned tasks is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Rohan Sharma
