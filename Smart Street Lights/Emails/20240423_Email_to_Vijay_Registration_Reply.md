Subject: Re: Follow-up: Smart Street Light Project - Registration Status

Hi Vijay,

Thank you for the update on the ITI Limited empanelment process. It's great to see that you've made significant progress with the documentation.

Regarding your questions about next steps:

1.  **Specialization Area:** "ICT Based-Governance" seems appropriate for our work experience, particularly for the Smart Street Lights project which involves IoT-based governance of public infrastructure. Let's proceed with this selection.

2.  **Next Steps:**
    *   Once you receive the CA certificate today, please compile all documents into a single organized package.
    *   Submit the complete application package through the ITI Limited portal.
    *   After submission, please send me the confirmation/acknowledgment receipt.
    *   I will then inform Mr. Sindhu Gupta (9412956000) about the completed registration so he can process it further.

3.  **Additional Information:**
    *   Please ensure all documents are properly signed and stamped where required.
    *   Keep digital copies of all submitted documents for our records.
    *   Note any application/reference numbers provided during submission.

Let me know if you encounter any issues during the final submission process or if you need any clarification.

Thanks for your diligent work on this.

Best regards, Rohan
