Subject: Follow-up: Smart Street Light Project - BOM Request

Hi Anurag,

Hope you're having a good week.

Just wanted to gently follow up on my email from April 16th regarding the detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) for the Smart Street Light and Control Modules.

Could you please let me know if you've had a chance to compile this information? Having the BOM is the next critical step for us to begin checking component availability, getting cost estimates, and placing orders for the initial prototypes.

Please let me know if there's anything I can help with or clarify from my end.

Thanks,

Rohan
