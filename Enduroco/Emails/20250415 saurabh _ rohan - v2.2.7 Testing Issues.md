Subject: Issues Found During Enduroco v2.2.7 Testing

Sir,

I've encountered several issues while testing version 2.2.7. Here's a breakdown:

* The timezone is not editable.
* Unable to log in to Strava using Gmail authentication.
* Getting a black screen on Garmin Connect.
* There's a typo in the word "strength" under the plan, displaying it as "strent"
* Threshold is not updating and getting an error message.
* Encountering a black page when selecting any volume selection method.
* (iOS Chat) Once we click and the keyboard opens, it gets stuck on the screen. Can't go back and have to kill the app.
* Nothing happens after clicking "Ok" on the intervals connecting page.
* (Video) When I click on "unlock premium option" and choose the monthly plan, after processing, it stays on the same subscription page. After waiting and clicking again, I got an error. Only after lastly clicking on unlock premium option, it shows active.

I've attached pictures for your reference.
