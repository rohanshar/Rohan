Subject: Enduroco App v2.2.8 Released - Bug Fixes

Hi Team,

Version 2.2.8 of the Enduroco mobile app has been released today, April 16, 2024.

This release focuses on addressing several bugs identified during the v2.2.7 testing phase. Key fixes include:

*   Timezone is now editable.
*   Fixed the black screen issue encountered with Garmin Connect.
*   Resolved the error message when updating the threshold.
*   Fixed the black page appearing when selecting volume selection methods.
*   Addressed the issue where the iOS chat keyboard would get stuck on screen.

Please familiarize yourselves with these changes. Testing on this version can commence.

Known issues still being worked on:
*   Unable to log in to Strava using Gmail authentication (Advise users to use OTP login).
*   Typo in "strength" under plan (Investigating - may be display width issue).
*   Nothing happens after clicking "Ok" on the intervals connecting page.
*   Subscription flow issues - stays on the same page after processing.

Thanks,
Rohan
