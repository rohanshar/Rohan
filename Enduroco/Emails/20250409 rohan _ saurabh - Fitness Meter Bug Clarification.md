Subject: Clarification on Enduroco App Fitness Meter Bug

Hi Saurabh,

Regarding the reported bug where the fitness meter is not showing in the Enduroco mobile app, I was able to see the fitness meter in Abhishek's account on the dashboard page.

To properly address this, could you please provide detailed steps on how to reproduce the issue? Specifically, please clarify:

*   Which user accounts are affected?
*   What specific steps are needed to replicate the bug (e.g., specific device, app version, navigation path)?
*   Screenshots or a screen recording demonstrating the issue would be very helpful.

Once we have a clear understanding of how to reproduce the bug, we can investigate and resolve it effectively.

Thanks,
Rohan
