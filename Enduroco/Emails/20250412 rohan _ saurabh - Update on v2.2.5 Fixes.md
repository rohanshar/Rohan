Subject: Update on Enduroco v2.2.5 Fixes

Hi Saurabh,

Thank you for identifying these issues. To address these version 2.2.5 is in the process of building.

Here's an update on each point:

1.  Fixed - The "Unlock premium features" option has been removed from the homepage for subscribed users.

2.  Regarding the Settings/Subscribe issue - I couldn't reproduce this problem. The subscribe option should disappear about 10 seconds after opening the settings page. Could you please verify this behavior again and let me know if you're still experiencing it?

3.  Fixed - The redundant "Sign In" link on the main page has been removed.

4.  The "Welcome to Enduroco" message after login is intentional for now. Since logout functionality has been improved, users shouldn't see this message frequently. We're planning improvements to this flow in the next update and are keeping it for testing purposes.

5.  Fixed - The subscription page now redirects properly after successful subscription.

6.  Fixed - Active accounts no longer show the "Unlock premium features" option.

Please let me know if you notice any other issues or if you're still experiencing problems with any of the fixed items.

There is a new plan page also to test in this update. I plan from the point of view of production release now. Minor things can be documented separately but ignored for the next release.

Thanks,
Rohan
