Her other relatives started claiming ownership of the part registered by the opponent.

However, Uma Bagla, with the intention of deceiving the complainant and her son, hiding the correct facts, and with the intention of usurping the money, keeping them in confidence, registered 1/3rd share of half of the house and went to Ghaziabad to her daughter Richa Sharma wife of Rohan Sharma's (Res. H. No. 8/9 Rajendra Nagar Sector 3, Block 8, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad) house.
