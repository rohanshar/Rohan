Hello Monty ji,

  

This was a genuine transaction done against a property transfer. We have the deed and transaction details to prove the same as done on Feb 1st. 

  

Thereafter, the other party has wrongfully involved us in matter and we (uma Bagla) are not privy to the property dispute that goes with it. 

  

I request HDFC to release these blocked funds as soon as possible for Uma Bagla. Please respond with a tentative timeline as to when this will be done so that we can plan accordingly. 

  

In case you need a legal representation from us, we are happy to do so too. Please let us know. 

  

Regards

Richa
