Sir,

I am writing to you with regards to the IGRS application attached above. Upon investigation by me, the following facts have been revealed:

The previous owner of house no. 26/70 Birhana Road, Kanpur Nagar was Mrs. Durga Devi, wife of the late Lala Ghumilal Bagla. Before her death, she made a will in which the first and third sections of the building were given to her son Radhakrishna Bagla's wife Lakshmi Devi and her sons Anil, Ajay, and Rajdeep. Similarly, the land and the second section were given to her son Shrikrishna Bagla's wife, Mrs. Shyamala Devi, and her sons Alok, Mahendra, and Manoj.   

In this way, the seller in the disputed portion, Uma Bagla, wife of the late Anil Bagla, became the owner of her husband's 1/4 share. In 2019, Mrs. Lakshmi Devi gifted her 1/4 share to her son Ajay Bagla through a gift deed. On 01.02.2025, Uma Bagla, wife of the late Anil Bagla, registered 1/3 share instead of her 1/4 share to Hemant Bagla, son of Mahendra Bagla. Currently, neither party resides at house no. 26/70. Anil's wife Uma currently lives with her daughter in Ghaziabad. Inquiries in the neighborhood revealed that Uma had not lived here for almost 10 years, although she would occasionally visit. Ajay Bagla would take the key from family members and leave within a day or two. The family property is undivided, and there is no partition.   

Currently, Ajay Bagla has filed a case no. 267/2025 in the Civil Court of Kanpur Nagar against 1. Uma Bagla, 2. Archana Bagla, and 3. Hemant Bagla. A copy of this is attached with the report. Sir, the above case is of a civil nature, and both parties are accusing each other. Both parties have locked the disputed room on site. Both parties have been advised to go to the Honorable Civil Court to present their case. No further police action seems necessary on the application.   

The report is hereby submitte
