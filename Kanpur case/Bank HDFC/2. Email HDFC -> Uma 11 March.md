Dear Mrs Bagla,

  

Greetings from HDFC Bank.

  

This is in reference to your email dated 26th  Feb'2025 addressed to HDFC BANK LTD Birhana road branch in relation to hold funds removal related.

  

I am sorry to inform you that we cannot remove hold funds marked to your account due to the following reasons:

  

• Order received from local Police Department to us for marking hold funds of Rs 30 Lakhs and Due to unavailability of NOC we are unable to remove hold funds. Order Copy attached for your reference.

  

  

  

  

Thanks and Regards,

Ishwar Tiwari
