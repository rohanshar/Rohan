### BLDC Fan Project Plan (From April 30, 2024)

**Goal:** Develop and manufacture 'Cheap' and 'Premium' BLDC fans meeting 25 Watts, 5-Star rating. Aiming for production start Mid-July 2025.

**Completed:**
- Applied for ISI mark.
- Found potential suppliers (Maa Sharda, Amit) and got samples.
- Set target: 25 Watts, 5-Star rating.
- Decided on two types: 'Cheap' and 'Premium'.

#### Project Update (May 9, 2025)
- **Meeting Held:** Attended by Arun Jha, Arun Sharma, Richa, Saurabh, Rohan.
- **Key Decision:** The project will proceed with sourcing a **completely new design PCB** from an external vendor. We will **not** be manufacturing PCBs at a component level.
- **Next Step (PCB):** Arun Sharma is evaluating vendors and will present a recommendation by May 14, 2025.
- **Next Meeting:** Scheduled for May 14, 2025, to finalize PCB vendor and discuss subsequent steps.

**Phase 1: Analysis & Sourcing (Completed by May 9th, 2025)**
- [x] **Check Sample Fans:** Open and compare mechanical parts and PCBs of Crompton, Maa Sharda, and Amit fans. #ArunSharma #Rohan *(Due: May 1st, 2025)* ✅ 2025-05-01
- [x] **Find PCB Suppliers:** Look for ready-made PCB options (local & online). Got initial info back. #ArunSharma *(Completed by May 7th, 2025)* ✅ *(Led to vendor evaluation phase)*
- [x] **Arun Jha to organize update meeting on BLDC.** #ArunJha *(Completed May 8th/9th, 2025)* ✅ *(Meeting held May 9th)*
- [x] **Decision: Make or Buy PCBs?** Based on fan analysis and PCB supplier info. #Team #meeting *(Decision made: May 9th, 2025)* ✅ *(Decision: Buy new design PCB)*

**Phase 2: Design & Finalization (Next Steps from May 9th, 2025)**
- [ ] **Arun Sharma to present PCB vendor recommendation.** (For new design PCBs) #ArunSharma *(Due: May 14th, 2025)*
- [ ] **Team to decide on final PCB vendor and specific new design PCBs.** (Based on Arun Sharma's recommendation) #Team #meeting *(Target: May 14th, 2025)*
- [ ] **Finalize Fan Body & Parts:** Confirm/adjust mechanical designs for both versions based on analysis and chosen PCB. #Team *(Lead: Arun S. / Rohan) (Due: May 16th, 2025)*
- [ ] **Document selected PCBs and integrate into overall design plan.** #Team *(Due: May 30th, 2025)*

**Phase 3: Prototyping & Testing (Due June 20th - Timelines to be reviewed after PCB finalization)**
- [ ] **Build First Sample Fans:** Assemble working prototypes (Cheap & Premium) with new PCBs. #Team *(Target: June 13th, 2025)*
- [ ] **Test Sample Fans:** Check if prototypes work well and meet 25W / 5-Star target. #Team *(Target: June 20th, 2025)*

**Phase 4: Manufacturing Prep (Due July 4th - Timelines to be reviewed)**
- [ ] **Plan for Manufacturing:** Finalize all parts, suppliers, and assembly plan. #Team *(Target: July 4th, 2025)*

**Goal: Start Production (Mid-July 2025 - Timelines to be reviewed)**
