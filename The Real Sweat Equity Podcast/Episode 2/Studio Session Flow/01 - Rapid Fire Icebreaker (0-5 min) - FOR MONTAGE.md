# 01 - Rapid Fire Icebreaker (0-5 minutes) - FOR MONTAGE

## Purpose
Before we dive into the real conversation, we'll start with a quick, fun icebreaker segment. This is just to help you (and us) get comfortable with the camera, settle in, and have a few laughs before the deeper story begins. These are 25 light, rapid-fire style questions—nothing serious, just for fun!

**We'll use this segment to create a short, energetic montage at the beginning of the episode to introduce you to the audience and set the tone.**
