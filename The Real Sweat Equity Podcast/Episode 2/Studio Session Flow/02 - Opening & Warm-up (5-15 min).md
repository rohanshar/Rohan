## Purpose
Rewind and understand who Garima was before the transformation

## Host Opening (Hitesh):
"Garima, welcome to The Real Sweat Equity mein. Humein bahut khushi hai ki aap Episode 2 mein humare saath hain. 

Lekin pehle, quick reminder humare viewers ke liye—agar aap Episode 1 miss kar gaye hain, jaake dekho, aur agar aap yahan new hain, please like, share, aur subscribe kar dijiye. Hum real stories laate hain, real transformations ke saath, aur aapka support means a lot.

Thoda rewind karte hain—kaun thi Garima before these ultra rides, before the medals, before this transformation?"

## Talking Points (Garima) + Answer Hints:
- **Left job, had a child**: "Maine job chod di thi, chhota beta tha ghar mein"
- **Running HR firm from home**: "Ghar se HR firm chala rahi thi, but wo seriously nahi chal raha tha"
- **Living with parents setup**: "Joint family mein rehte the, parents ke saath, bahut structured life thi"
- **Relationship challenges**: "Husband ke saath nahi reh rahe the us time, alag alag challenges the" (or any comfortable way she wants to mention this)
- **Identity crisis despite privilege**: "Silver spoon background tha, but identity crisis face kar rahi thi"
- **Societal expectations**: "Society ke expectations ke hisaab se sab kuch perfect tha on paper"
- **Felt invisible, voiceless**: "But andar se bilkul invisible feel karti thi, jaise meri koi voice hi nahi hai"

## Follow-up Questions to Deepen the Struggle:
- "Yeh invisibility day-to-day kaise lagti thi? Ghar mein, family mein?"
- "Privilege hone ke baawjood trapped feel kar rahe the—can you paint that picture for us?"

## Host Affirmation (Rohan):
"Matlab aap sab kuch kar rahe the jo 'supposed' to karna chahiye—business, family, responsibilities—but still it didn't feel like you. Structure tha but soul nahi tha. Society ne jo bola tha chahiye, sab tha, but something was missing—the real investment in yourself. Yeh bahut saare listeners relate kar paenge."

## Transition to Next Segment (Hitesh):
"Little did you know, aapka transformation chhup raha tha sabse unexpected jagah..."

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Started when left job, son was young
- Weight loss was "identity crisis" - silver spoon background
- Relationship with husband was strained
- Feeling suffocated, lack of seriousness in business
- Depression phase

## Amendment Notes:
- **Version 1.4 Change**: Added hint for Garima to mention not living with husband and relationship challenges in whatever comfortable way she prefers. This context is important for understanding her complete life situation during the struggle phase.
- **Version 1.5 Change**: Added like, share, subscribe call-to-action in opening segment to engage audience early and reference Episode 1.

## Time Target: 10 minutes
