# 02 - Opening & Warm-up (5-15 minutes)

## Purpose
Rewind and understand who Garima was before the transformation

## Host Opening (Hitesh):
"Garima, welcome to The Real Sweat Equity. We're so glad to have you on Episode 2 with us. Let's rewind a little—who was Garima before the ultra rides, before the medals, before the transformation?"

## Talking Points (Garima):
- Left job, had a child
- Running an HR firm
- Identity crisis despite privilege
- Societal expectations
- Felt invisible, voiceless

## Host Affirmation (Rohan):
"So you were doing everything you were 'supposed' to do—business, family, responsibilities—but it still didn't feel like you. You had the structure, but not the soul. That's something so many listeners will resonate with. But there was one space where you could just be, right?"

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Started when left job, son was young
- Weight loss was "identity crisis" - silver spoon background
- Relationship with husband was strained
- Feeling suffocated, lack of seriousness in business
- Depression phase

## Time Target: 10 minutes
