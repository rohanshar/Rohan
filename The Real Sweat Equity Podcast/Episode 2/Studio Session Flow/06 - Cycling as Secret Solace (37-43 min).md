## Purpose
Explore the secrecy and protection of her healing space

## Host Question (Rohan):

- Didn't want permission or validation
- Needed to protect her freedom

## Host Affirmation (Hitesh):
"You were guarding your healing. This wasn't just sport—it was your soul space. And you knew deep down: 'If I share it too early, I might lose it.' That tension built up to a moment we HAVE to talk about…"

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Kept it private initially - it was rebellious
- Papa catching her (keep this section)

## Time Target: 6 minutes
