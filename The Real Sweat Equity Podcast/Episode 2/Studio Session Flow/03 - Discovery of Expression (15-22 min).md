## Purpose
Explore the first pockets of freedom and authentic expression

## Host Question (Rohan):
"Was there any part of the day that felt like yours? Even briefly?"

## Talking Points (Garima):
- Weight training at home
- Old friend/trainer as emotional outlet
- Felt emotionally alive there

## Host Affirmation (Hitesh):
"That space with your trainerâ€”sounds like your first breath of fresh air in a suffocating routine. A reminder that expression begins in small pockets of safety. And then came the unexpected twist, right?"

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- "I have never been into sports. Sports was about sweating. That I hated."
- But this space felt different - it was freedom

## Time Target: 7 minutes
