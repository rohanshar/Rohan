# 04 - Spiritual Shift & Serendipity (22-30 minutes)

## Purpose
Dive into the magical day that started the cycling journey

## Host Question (Rohan):
"Let's talk about that magical day—the one that started it all."

## Talking Points (Garima):
- Buddhist scroll installed at home
- Next day, went to Decathlon
- Bought a cycle without planning
- Started cycling around the block

## Host Affirmation (Hitesh):
"That's almost poetic—the universe opened something inside you, and the next thing you know, you're riding. No agenda, just instinct. And that instinct took you from local loops to something so much bigger."

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Spiritual angle - Ganesh installed and cycle came
- Why cycling - it felt like freedom
- First ride experience
- Kept it private initially - it was rebellious

## Time Target: 8 minutes
