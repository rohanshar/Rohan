# 05 - First Liberation (30-37 minutes)

## Purpose
Understand when cycling became deeper than fitness

## Host Question (Hitesh):
"At what point did you realize this wasn't just about fitness—but something way deeper?"

## Talking Points (Garima):
- Ride to India Gate
- First time she felt joy, freedom
- Realized she had been depressed all along
- That freedom helped her understand her past

## Host Affirmation (Rohan):
"That's huge. You didn't just break a cycling barrier—you broke emotional denial. Sometimes we don't even know we're in pain… until we feel peace. But when you found that, you also chose to keep it hidden, right?"

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Why cycling - it felt like freedom
- Depression phase recognition
- Identity crisis clarity

## Time Target: 7 minutes
