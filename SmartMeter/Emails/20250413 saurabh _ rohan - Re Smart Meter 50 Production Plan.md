Subject: Re: Smart Meter 50 Production Plan - Follow Up Questions

Sir,

I discussed the smart meter production plan with Anil Sir. We both think we should outsource this lot and proceed with a batch of at least 50 units. As the 10 units we prepared last time are nowhere to be found now.

Regarding outsourcing, we can leverage vendors that can provide in-house testing facilities. One of our team members can be present at their facility to oversee testing and debugging. Additionally, these vendors already have some of the required components on hand, which can save us a significant amount of time.

To make this happen, we should clear their previous pending payments. The second step would be PCB fabrication, followed by component mounting. In the meantime, we also need to arrange for SIM cards and meter bodies.

Regards,

Saurabh Singh
