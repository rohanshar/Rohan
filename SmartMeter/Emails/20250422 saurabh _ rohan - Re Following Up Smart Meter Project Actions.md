Sir,

Regarding the vendor payments, the vendor has sent the previous bill with an updated latest date as per our request. Arun Sharma, please proceed with the payment as soon as possible.

Concerning the PCB fabrication, yes, I have already placed an order for the fabrication of 50 PCBs. The vendor will provide me with an update soon, after which I will forward the Bill of Materials (BOM) to them.

Regarding the BCS download session, my availability is open on Thursday morning for a 30-minute session.

Regards,

Saurabh Singh
