Subject: Smart Meter Project Update & Next Steps - Outsourcing 50+ Units

Hi Team (Saurabh, Anil, Arun),

Following up on our recent discussions and Saurabh's confirmation
email, we have decided to proceed with outsourcing the production of
the next batch of smart meters, targeting 50+ units for evaluation.
This approach leverages vendor capabilities, including in-house
testing and potentially faster component sourcing.

To move forward efficiently, here are the immediate next steps and
assigned actions:

1.  **Clear Vendor Payments:** #Saurabh #Arun - Please prioritize
clearing any outstanding payments with the selected outsourcing vendor
to initiate the process.
2.  **PCB Fab & Mounting:** #Saurabh - Please coordinate with the
vendor to begin PCB fabrication and component mounting.
3.  **Procure Ancillaries:** #Saurabh #Arun - Please arrange for the
necessary SIM cards and meter bodies required for the 50+ units.
4.  **Long-Term Vendor Research:** #Arun - Please continue researching
and identifying potential long-term vendors for the components
previously identified in the BOM shortage list.
5.  **BCS Encryption Details:** #Anil - Please provide the necessary
documentation regarding encryption for the BCS application.
6.  **BCS Download Functionality:** #Rohan #Saurabh - We still need to
schedule the 30-min working session to restore the existing BCS
download functionality. Saurabh, please let me know your availability.

Let's ensure close coordination on these parallel tasks. Please
confirm your understanding of these actions and flag any immediate
blockers or concerns.

Thanks,
Rohan
