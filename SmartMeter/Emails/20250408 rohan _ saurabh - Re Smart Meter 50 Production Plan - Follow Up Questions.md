Subject: Re: Smart Meter 50 Production Plan - Follow Up Questions

Hi Saurabh,

Thanks for sending over the detailed production plan for the initial 50 smart meters. I appreciate you putting that together.

Before we fully commit and kick off procurement, I wanted to get your thoughts on a couple of strategic points regarding this first evaluation batch:

1.  Production Approach (In-house vs. Outsource): Based on the plan and current resources/capabilities, what is your recommendation for actually assembling these 50 units? Should we handle this entirely in-house, or would it be more efficient/effective to outsource the assembly for this specific batch? Please provide some reasoning for your recommendation.

2.  Batch Size Confirmation (50 Units): The goal of this batch is primarily evaluation, testing, and gauging performance/stability. With that in mind, is 50 units the right number to start with, or do you think a smaller initial batch (e.g., 10 or 25) might be more prudent to identify any immediate issues before committing to the full 50? What are the pros and cons you see?

Your input on these two points will help us finalize the immediate next steps. Could you please share your thoughts and justifications on these questions?

Thanks,
Rohan
