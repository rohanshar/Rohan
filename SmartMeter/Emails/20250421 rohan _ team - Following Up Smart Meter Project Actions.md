2.  **PCB Fab & Mounting:** (Saurabh) Has coordination with the vendor begun?
3.  **SIM Cards & Meter Bodies:** (Saurabh/Arun) Progress on arranging these?
4.  **Long-Term Vendor Research:** (Arun) Any updates on identifying potential vendors?
5.  **BCS Encryption Details:** (Anil) ETA for the documentation?

Please share your updates by the end of today if possible, or let me know if there are any blockers.
