Subject: Re: Smart Meter Project Actions - PCB Delivery & Saral Sanchar Meeting Request

Dear Sir,

I have received confirmation that the PCBs have been delivered. Please note that tomorrow is a holiday at the vendor's end, so I will send the Bill of Materials on Friday to proceed with component mounting.

Arun, could you please set aside some time to meet with me tomorrow to discuss any questions or clarifications needed regarding the Saral Sanchar certificate renewal?

I will keep you updated on the PCB fabrication timeline as I receive more information.


Regards,

Saurabh Singh
