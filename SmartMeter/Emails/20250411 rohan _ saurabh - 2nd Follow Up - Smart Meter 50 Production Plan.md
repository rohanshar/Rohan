Subject: Following Up: Smart Meter 50 Production Plan - In-house vs. Outsource & Batch Size

Hi Saurabh,

Hope you're having a productive week.

I'm following up on my email from April 8th regarding the production plan for the initial 50 smart meters. Specifically, I'd appreciate your input on these two points:

1.  Production Approach (In-house vs. Outsource): Based on the plan and our current resources/capabilities, what's your recommendation for assembling the 50 units?
2.  Batch Size Confirmation (50 Units): Do you think 50 units is the right number for the evaluation batch, or would a smaller initial batch be better?

Your insights here are key to moving forward with procurement and the next steps. Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,
Rohan
