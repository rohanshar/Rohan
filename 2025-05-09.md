This list is generated based on tasks that are:
*   Marked `[ ]` (not completed).
*   Not tagged with `#waiting`.
*   Either explicitly assigned to you (`#Rohan`), assigned to `#Team` (assuming you're part of it), or unassigned and seem to be your responsibility (e.g., general `#computer` tasks not delegated to someone else). Tasks assigned solely to other individuals (e.g., `#Saurabh`, `#ArunSharma`) without your tag are excluded from this list for *your* direct actions today.

Remember to update your `.md` files as you complete these tasks!
