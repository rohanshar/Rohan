Hi Team,

This email is to provide a quick update on our Low-Cost LCD Meter project and outline the current next actions:

1. **Cost Reduction Analysis (Arun Sharma):** Arun, please continue to investigate the potential cost differential if we:
    
    - Reduce the cabinet size.
    - Utilize a single shunt for measurement.
    - Develop a new single-sided unified PCB.
    - Use a smaller LCD. We're looking to understand the overall cost reduction these changes could bring.
2. **Microcontroller Research (Saurabh):** Saurabh, please continue your research into identifying a lower-cost, readily available microcontroller that could be suitable for this project.
    

Please keep us updated on your progress. Let's aim to discuss findings and next steps soon.

Best regards,

Rohan
