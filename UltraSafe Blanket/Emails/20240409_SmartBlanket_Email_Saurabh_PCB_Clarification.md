Subject: Clarification & Next Steps: Smart Blanket PCB

Hi Saurabh,

This email is to clarify the current status of our PCB requirements and plan the next steps.

*   **Devendar's Initial PCBs (Marked 23111):** The initial 5 sample PCBs received from Devendar (marked '23111') are buggy and unusable. Please disregard these boards completely for all future reference and communication.

*   **Devendar's Corrected PCB:** We understand Devendar has provided corrected Gerber files. Could you confirm if you received these? We also have his price quote for 200 units, but no order has been placed. For now this is second choice and hold any which ways.

*   **Amit's Parallel PCB Design:** Amit has developed an alternative design which may be more cost-effective. We would prefer to explore this option first.

*   **Next Steps & Action Required:**
    *   To evaluate Amit's design, he needs a 1-hour meeting with RK sir for discussion/finalization. Could you please help arrange this meeting?
    *   Our plan is to order 5 prototype PCBs first (ideally Amit's design, pending the meeting outcome) before committing to the larger 200-unit order.

Please let me know if arranging the meeting between Amit and RK sir is possible.

Thanks,
Rohan
