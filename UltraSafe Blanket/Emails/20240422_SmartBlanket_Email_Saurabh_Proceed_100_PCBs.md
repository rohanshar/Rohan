Subject: Proceed with Order: 100 Smart Blanket PCBs

Hi Saurabh,

Thanks for the update that the 5 prototype PCBs have been assembled, cased, and are testing well with the production team. That's great news.

Please proceed with placing the order for the next batch of 100 PCBs using the same design that was used for the successfully tested prototypes.

Could you please confirm once the order is placed and let me know the expected timeline for delivery?

Thanks,

Rohan
