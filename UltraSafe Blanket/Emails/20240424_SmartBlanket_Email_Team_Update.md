Subject: UltraSafe Electric Blanket Project Update - Prototypes Successful, 100 PCBs Ordered

Hi Team,

Sharing a quick update on the UltraSafe Electric Blanket project (formerly Smart Blanket):

**Recent Progress:**

*   **Prototype Success:** The 5 prototype PCBs based on the revised design have been successfully assembled, cased, and are currently undergoing testing by the production team. Initial feedback is positive.
*   **PCB Order Placed:** Based on the successful prototype testing, we have placed an order for 100 units of the same PCB design.
*   **Expected Delivery:** We expect the delivery of these 100 PCBs by coming Monday (28 April).

**Next Steps:**

*   **Continued Testing:** Saurabh, please continue to monitor the testing of the 5 prototypes and report back on the findings by Wednesday, April 24th, as planned.
*   **BOM Preparation:** Saurabh, please also prepare the Bill of Materials (BOM) for these 100 units, highlighting any components that might be difficult to procure.
*   **Production Planning:** Once the 100 PCBs arrive and testing is fully validated, we will move towards planning the assembly and production run.

Thanks to everyone for their efforts in moving this forward! Let's keep the momentum going.

Best regards,

Rohan
