Is Marcus correct? Explain your answer. I want to find the whole number value of C that gets an answer closest to F=0 I think the closest I can get to F=0 is when C=−17 When you divide a number by a decimal, use the place value of the decimal to work out an easier equivalent calculation. An easier equivalent calculation is to divide by a whole number instead of a decimal. For example, you can write 6.3÷0.7 as 6 3 0 7 . . Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by 10 gives 6 3 10 0 7 10 63 7 . . × × = This makes an equivalent calculation that is much easier to do, because dividing by 7 is much easier than dividing by 0.7.
