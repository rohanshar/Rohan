        Balanced or unbalanced?
        Look at any object that is not moving.
        You may think that if an object is not moving, no
        forces are acting to push, pull or twist it. This is not
        true.
        Look at the rock in the picture. The force of gravity
        is pulling it toward the centre of the Earth. This force
        is called its weight. The rock does not move toward                                             contact force

        the centre of the Earth because the ground is pushing
        up on the rock. This force is the contact force.
        These two forces are balanced. This means the forces                                                         rock
        are equal in size and opposite in direction.

        There could be more than two forces acting on

        Imagine the wind is blowing. The wind will push
        the rock from one side.
        Why does the rock not move sideways? The pushing
        force from the wind is balanced by friction between
        the rock and the ground.
        These forces can be shown in a force diagrams. In a
                                                                            on the rock.

                                                                            The force diagram shows the balanced forces acting

         The rock will now move because the sideways forces are not balanced.
         This can be shown on the force diagram.
         The rock will now start to move in the direction of the larger
         sideways force.
         The rock will not move up or down because the forces acting up and
         down are still balanced.

         Unbalanced or unequal forces can also make moving objects slow down.
         A parachute makes a falling object slow down.
         When an object is falling quickly, the parachute causes a force of air
         resistance that is larger than the weight of the object.

           When the parachute first opens, the forces                When the object slows, the air resistance
           are unbalanced. This unbalanced force                     decreases, so the forces become balanced

        Changing direction
        Unbalanced forces can also make objects change direction.
        This tennis ball will change direction because of an unbalanced force.
        When the ball contacts the tennis racket, the ball pushes on the tennis
        racket. To make the ball go back in the opposite direction, the hitting
        force must be larger than the force from the ball.
        This can be shown in a force diagram.

         3 Forces and energy


         Summary
         •	   When forces are equal in size and opposite in direction, the forces
              are balanced.
         •	   Balanced forces cause no change in movement.
         •	   When forces are not equal in size and/or act in directions that are
              not opposite, the forces are unbalanced.
         •	   Unbalanced forces cause change in movement: speeding up, slowing
              down or changing direction.

         3 Forces and energy



           Activity 3.1.1
           Balanced or unbalanced forces?
           On a large piece of paper, draw a table with two columns: one for balanced forces and
           one for unbalanced forces.
           Put each of these situations into the correct column, according to the forces that are acting.
           The situations are:
           •    a motorcycle going around a corner
           •




                                                                                E
                a boy on a skateboard slowing down
           •    a bowling ball rolling at constant speed in a straight line
           •    a girl on a swing getting faster
           •    a computer sitting on a desk
           •
           •
                a helicopter going straight upwards at a constant speed
                a coconut falling from a tree and getting faster.


         How did you decide which situations had balanced forces and which
         had unbalanced forces?
         Did your strategy work?
         Could you use this strategy again, or would you change it?
                                                                              PL

               What are the speed limits for cars where you live?
               Signs showing speed limits usually do not have units.

        There are many different units of speed. Different units are sometimes
        used in different countries and for different things. For example, the
        speed of ships is often measured in knots, whereas aeroplanes often use

         3 Forces and energy


         So, to avoid confusion, scientists use standard units for measurement in
         all countries.
         The standard unit for speed is metres per second.
         The word per means ‘in each’. Therefore, metres per second means the
         number of metres travelled in each second. For example, a horse running
         with a speed of 15 metres per second means the horse travels a distance
         of 15 metres in each second.
         Metres per second is written as m/s.




                                             E
         Calculating speed
         The way you calculate speed is linked to the unit metres per second, m/s.
         For example, think of a bus that travels a distance of 100 m in a time of 20 s.

         each 1 s?


                                           PL
         The bus has travelled 100 m in 20 s, so how many metres does it travel in


                                                            ​​ total distance
                number of metres travelled in each second = _________________
                                                              




                                     speed = ​​ _________________
                                                                  
                                                                              travelled
                                                                      total time

                    number of metres travelled in each second = speed, so

                                                total distance travelled ​​
                                                                                        ​​

                                                20 s
                                            = 5 m/s
SA

         You can summarise this equation for speed as:


                                                 ​​  distance
                                         speed = _______      ​​ 
                                                       time


         Note: the term average speed is sometimes used because the speed of
         an object during a journey is not always constant. Constant means not
         changing. Average speed is calculated in exactly the same way as speed.
         The equation for speed can be used in a formula triangle. This means
         you can also use the equation to calculate:
         •	   the distance travelled, if you know the speed and the time taken
         •	   the time taken, if you know the speed and the distance travelled.

        The worked examples above both use metres, seconds and metres per
        second. Sometimes, the values are given in different units. So, for example,
        if you have a distance in km and a time in hours, the equation will give you
        a speed in km/h as you are dividing a distance in km by a time in hours.

        Distance–time graphs
        Scientists use graphs to describe how two variables are related.
        We can use graphs to describe the movement of an object.
        One way to do this is to plot distance travelled on the vertical axis and
        time on the horizontal axis.
        A graph like this is called a distance–time graph.
        Graphs are more useful than words for describing movement because:
        •	   it is easier to see trends and patterns




                                              E
        •	   you can read any value of distance or time during the journey,
             from the graph
        •	   other values, such as speed, can be calculated from a graph

             information about the whole journey can be seen easily.
        This is a distance–time graph. It shows the journey of a car from a
        starting position A to a destination, C. The car then returns to its

        Now take a closer look at what the graph shows in each of the four
        sections. These sections are in different colours so you can see
        them clearly.
        1	 At the starting position, A, the object has travelled zero distance.
           The car travels at a constant speed away from the starting position
           to point B. When moving at constant speed, the car travels the
           same distance in each second. The distance from the start increases
           with time. The distance–time graph show this as a straight, upward
           sloping line.
        2	 The car stops at B. It is stationary. Stationary means not moving,
           with a speed of zero. You can also use the term at rest to mean
           stationary. The distance of the car from the start position does
           not change when the object is stationary, but time still passes.
           The distance–time graph shows a straight line that is horizontal.



                                                                                                                     79to publication.

         3	 The car starts again and moves at a constant speed to its destination,
            point C. It moves faster than when it travelled between A and B,
            meaning it travels a greater distance each second. So, the distance–time
            graph show this as a steeper straight, upward sloping line.
         4	 From point C, the car travels at a constant speed back to the
            starting position, A. The distance of the object from the start will
            decrease with time. The distance–time graph shows this as a straight,
            downward sloping line.
         The distance–time graph for the car journey was a sketch. If you draw

         a sketch graph you do not have to put numbers on your graph axes.
         Sometimes, distance–time graphs have values on the axes. This means
         you can use the graph to make calculations. Read the distance from the
         vertical axis, and the time from the horizontal axis. Then use the equation:

          The journey could be walking or any other
          method of travel.
          The journey could be coming to school or a
          longer journey.
          Sketch a distance–time graph for that journey.

          Method
          You need to calculate the average speed of walking for one person in the group, in m/s.
          You then need to calculate the average speed of running for one person in the group, in m/s.
          It does not have to be the same person.
          1	 Plan what measurements you will need to make and how you will make these
             measurements.
          2	 Make a list of the safety precautions that the person who is running should take.

             3 Forces and energy



             Turning effects of forces
             When you push down on a door handle, the handle turns.
             When you push down on the pedal of a bicycle, the pedal turns.
             When you pull on a door, the door turns toward you.
             These are all examples of forces that cause an object to turn.
             The object that turns is called a lever.
             The point around which the lever turns is called the pivot.




                                                    E
             The lever and pivot are shown in the picture of the bicycle pedals
             in Figure 3.4.1.
             When you bend your arm, the arm acts as a lever. Your elbow is the pivot.

             Calculating moments
             The moment of a force describes its the turning effect of a force.
             The moment of a force depends on:
             •	   the size of the force (the bigger the force, the bigger the moment)
             •	   the distance between the position where the force acts and the pivot
                  (the greater the distance, the greater the moment).
             You can calculate a moment from this equation:

                                         moment = force × distance

        Distance in the equation is the distance from the pivot to the position
        where the force acts.
        The unit of force is the newton and the unit of distance is the metre.
        Therefore, the unit of moment is newton × metre, which is written as
        newton metre or N m.
        Remember to use an upper case N and a lower case m when writing N m.

         Balancing
         A seesaw is a type of lever.
         People sit on either side of the pivot of a seesaw and
         make the lever turn one way and then the other.
         The result is that each person moves up and down.
         A seesaw will be balanced when the moments on
         both sides of the pivot are equal and opposite.

          Continued
          Make a prediction about what will happen to the force needed to pull the metre rule
          down as the distance between the force and the pivot decreases.
          Method
          1	 Move the loop of string with the newton meter as far from the pivot as you can.
          2	 Record the distance between the pivot and the string.
          3	 Raise the newton meter so it is not pulling down on the metre rule.




                                             E
          4	 Use the newton meter to pull down on the metre rule. The distance that you pull
             depends on the strength of the elastic band. The metre rule needs to be pulled
             down far enough to get a reading of about 1 N at the furthest point from the pivot.
          5	 Record this distance. This will be the distance you pull down on the metre rule
             each time.
          6	 Record the force.


                                           PL
          7	 Repeat this, pulling the metre rule down the same distance each time.
             Each time, use the loop of string to move the newton metre closer to the pivot.
          8	 Your results should be a set of distances and forces.
          9	 Decide whether you need to repeat any of your measurements.
          Results and questions

          1	 Describe how you made the experiment safe.
          2	 Record your results in a table. Make sure that you record distances in metres,
             so you may need to convert from cm or mm. Remember to reverse the order
             of your results, so in the table the distances are increasing.
          3	 Draw a line graph of your results. Put distance on the horizontal axis and

             force on the vertical axis.

         3 Forces and energy



         The pushing effect of a force
         The picture shows a knife being used to cut modelling clay.

                                              PL
         What could you do if the clay was difficult to cut?


         The knife works because the force used to push down on the clay causes
         pressure on the clay.
         You can think of pressure as the pushing effect of a force.
         Suppose the clay is difficult to cut. How could you increase the pushing
         effect of the force?
         You could:
                        M
         •	   increase the force on the knife; as the force increases, the pressure
              increases
         •	   use a sharper knife (a sharp knife has less surface area in contact
              with the clay); as the area decreases, the pressure increases.
SA

         The equation linking pressure, force and area is


                                                  ​​  force
                                       pressure = ____area  ​​


         Pressure is force divided by area. The unit of force is the newton and
         the unit of area is the metre squared. That means the unit of pressure is
         newtons per metre squared, or N/m2.
         Sometimes you can use smaller areas, measured in cm2. If the area is
         in cm2 then the unit of pressure will be N/cm2. If the area was in mm2,
         what would the unit of pressure be?
         Some things have large areas to decrease pressure; others have small
         areas to increase pressure.

         The camel has large feet. This
         means the force from the weight
         of the camel is applied over a
         large area. The pressure on the
         sand is decreased, so the camel
         will not sink in the sand.

         The woman in the picture is

         has a sharp point on the end.
         The weight of the woman acts
         on many hundreds of nails, so
         the pressure from each nail is
         very small.

         The increased pressure means

         Scissors have sharp blades. The
         area along the cutting edge

        Pressure in liquids
        Look at the picture of a dam. The wall of this dam is wider at the
        bottom than it is at the top.




                                             E
                                           PL
        The water comes out with more force than from the upper gaps
                       M
        Behind the wall of the dam, the water is almost to the top of the wall.
        You can see water coming out from two levels.
        The water coming out close to the top is coming out with less force.
        The water coming out from further down is coming out with more force.
SA

        This is because pressure in the water increases with depth.
        The wall is wider at the bottom to make the wall stronger where the
        pressure from the water is greatest.

        Pressure and depth in liquids
        The pressure in a liquid increases with depth, but why?
        As you go deeper in a liquid, there is more liquid above your position.
        The weight of this liquid, caused by gravity, pushes on the particles of
        the liquid.
        When the particles of the liquid are pushed, they move with more force.
        As the particles in a liquid are moving randomly in all directions, then
        the pressure in the liquid is equal in all directions.

         3 Forces and energy



         Pressure in gases
         Before you blow up a balloon, there is a small volume
         of air inside the balloon. The balloon is open at one
         end, so the pressure of the air inside is the same as the
         pressure of the air outside.
         As you blow air into the balloon, you are adding
         more gas particles.
         Particles in a gas move randomly and collide with the




                                                  E
         walls of the container. The container is the balloon.
         Every time a gas particle collides with the wall of
         the container, the particle exerts a small force on
         the wall.




                                                PL
         The more particles there are in the gas, the more collisions happen
         with the walls, and so the force on the walls increases.
         As this force is exerted on an area, the force causes pressure.
         The pressure inside the balloon gets bigger as you blow in more air,
         pushing the walls of the balloon outwards.

         The pressure of the air in this tyre is too low.                                          causing pressure.

        The air inside the tyre is at low pressure. The pressure is not enough
        to support the weight of the vehicle.
        If more air is put inside the tyre, the pressure will increase. More
        collisions will happen with the inside walls of the tyre, pushing the
        tyre outward and supporting the vehicle.

        Pressure and depth in gases
        As with liquids, the pressure in a gas increases with depth.
        Most people on Earth live at low altitude. Altitude is height above sea level.




                                             E
        The Earth’s atmosphere, which we call air, is made from gases.
        The atmosphere extends to a height of about above sea level.
        Sea level is, therefore, where the atmosphere is at its deepest.
        So, at sea level, atmospheric pressure is highest.

        atmospheric pressure change:
        •	

        •	
             of gas particles decreases    PL
        As you go higher in the atmosphere, two variables that affect

             the number of particles in of air decreases, so the concentration

             the weight of air above your current position decreases.
        Atmospheric pressure at sea level is about . This pressure is the
        equivalent of the weight of two large elephants pushing on every of

        we live in the atmosphere all the time.


        Effects of atmospheric pressure
        The effect of atmospheric pressure can be shown by pumping

        the air out of a metal container.
        Before the air is pumped out, the pressure on the inside of the
        container is equal to the pressure on the outside.
        When the air is pumped out, the pressure inside the container
        becomes close to zero. The pressure on the outside does
        not change.
        The container is crushed by the pressure of the air outside
        the container. The picture shows a containercrushed by
        atmospheric pressure.

         3 Forces and energy


         Pressure and temperature in gases
         As the temperature of a gas increases, the speed of the particles in the
         gas increases.
         When particles are travelling faster, their collisions exert more force.
         This means that increasing the temperature of a gas will
         increase the pressure of the gas.
         High pressure can be used to cook food.
         The picture shows a type of cooking pot called a




                                             E
         pressure cooker.
         Water and food are placed inside the pressure cooker.
         The pressure cooker has a sealed lid. When the water
         boils, the steam cannot escape so the pressure of the
         gas inside increases.

        Mixing gases
        The particles in a gas move randomly. Both the speed of the particles
        and the direction of the particles are random.
        If we mix two gases in one container, each one will have particles that
        move randomly.
        That means each gas will spread to fill the container.
        The movement of the particles of each gas is called diffusion.
        Diffusion means the overall random movement of particles from an




                                             E
        area where they are in higher concentration to an area where they are
        in lower concentration. Concentration is the number of particles in a
        particular volume.
        Look at the diagrams. They show how two gases diffuse.

         3 Forces and energy


         The gas particles from the food move randomly
         and so spread out through the air by diffusion.
         The strength of the smell will get stronger as you
         move closer to the food. This is because the
         concentration of the particles is higher, the closer
         you get to the source of the particles.
         Many animals use this change in strength of
         smell to find food.

         •    temperature.
         The bigger the difference in the concentrations of the particles, the faster
         the diffusion.
         The higher the temperature, the faster the diffusion. Higher temperature
         makes particles move faster, so the particles can spread out faster.
         For example, when you make a cup of tea, the tea diffuses through the
         water. It diffuses faster in hot water than it does in cold water.

          The effect of temperature on the speed of diffusion
          In this investigation, you will investigate how temperature affects the rate of
          diffusion in liquids.
          Work in groups of two or three.

                                           PL
          1	 Add equal volumes of water at different temperatures to each of your beakers.
          2	 Measure and record the temperature of the water in each beaker.
          3	 Use the dropper pipette to carefully add a small volume of the ink to the
             bottom of each beaker. Squeeze the top of the pipette gently so the ink
             does not squirt out into the water and start mixing.
               Add the ink to the water in order from the lowest to the highest temperature.
          4	 Use a stopwatch to time diffusion process in each beaker.

         3 Forces and energy



           Project: Making a balance for weighing
           This project is about using moments to find the weights of objects. You will make
           a balance and then use it to find some unknown weights.
           Background
           The earliest balances for weighing
           needed equal weights on both
           sides of the balance.
           The unknown weight was placed




                                             E
           on one side, and known weights
           were added on the other side until
           the system balanced.
           A system such as this is balanced
           because there are two moments
           acting.
           One moment tries to pull one
           side down.
           The other moment tries to pull
           the other side down.
           When the moments are equal
                                           PL
           and opposite, the system is balanced.
                       M
           This happens when the weights are equal because the distances from the pivot
           are also equal.
           Your task
           Make a balance that can be used to weigh a range of different weights without
           changing the known weight.
SA

           Your balance will work in a different way to the one in the picture, so yours will
           not look like this.
           Work in groups.
           You can use equipment such as:
           •    a metre rule
           •    a triangular prism
           •    a known weight
           •    any other equipment that your teacher makes available.

          Continued
          Remember:
          •    do not confuse weight with mass
          •    weight is a force
          •    the moment caused by a force depends on the distance from the pivot.
          When your balance is made and working, you can demonstrate to the class
          how it works.

        A desert in Arizona
        The photograph shows the Sonoran Desert in Arizona,
        in the USA.
        Deserts are not easy places for animals and plants to live.
        Deserts do not get much rainfall, so the organisms that live
        there must have adaptations that help them to survive with
        little water.
        The tall plants in the photograph are saguaro cacti. They grow




                                             E
        very slowly, and those in the photograph may be more than
        100 years old. Their roots spread out widely just underneath
        the soil, ready to absorb any rain that falls.
        Many animals live among the cacti and other desert plants.




                                           PL
        Gila woodpeckers make holes in the cacti, to make their
        nests. Other birds also visit these holes.
        Cactus wrens often use a different kind of cactus, called
        a teddy bear cholla, to make their nests. Teddy bear
        chollas are so spiky that very few other animals will get
        close to them. So the cactus wren’s eggs and young ones
        are protected from predators.

         4 Ecosystems


         During the hot days, lizards, tortoises and other animals
         rest in the shade of the plants, or burrow into the soil
         where it is cooler. At night, when the temperature falls,
         kangaroo rats come out to feed, wary of their predators
         such as rattlesnakes and coyotes.
         In the Sonoran Desert, it usually rains heavily at least once a
         year. When the rains come, the desert is transformed. Many
         plants quickly produce flowers.
         Insects feed on the nectar and pollen in the flowers, helping
         the plants to reproduce by pollinating them. At night, bats

                                                                                    A kangaroo rat
         feed on nectar from the flowers of agave plants.
         Seeds fall to the ground and are collected by ants, to take
         into their nests to provide a food store. Many months or
         years later, some of the uneaten seeds may germinate to
         produce new plants.

          of rough paper, make a rough sketch of the design for your picture.

          organisms, or stick cut-out pictures of them onto the paper. Write descriptions
          about how they interact with each other.


        Non-living things in the desert
                       M
        It is not only other organisms that affect the plants and animals
        in the Arizona desert. There are also interactions between the
        organisms and the non-living parts of their environment.
        • Light: The bright sunlight helps the plants to photosynthesise,
          producing food that other organisms can eat.
SA

        • Temperature: The temperature is often very high during the
          day, but much lower at night. Some animals are nocturnal,
          which helps them to avoid overheating or drying out. It is
          cooler underneath the soil, so some animals – such as the
          tarantula in the picture – dig burrows for shelter during
          the day.
        • Soil: Rocks and soil provide minerals for the plants to grow,
          as well as building material for ground-nesting birds.

         • Water: All organisms need water to keep their cells
           alive. Rain, when it comes, allows them to become
           more active and to reproduce.
         • Air: The desert air provides carbon dioxide for the
           plants to use in photosynthesis, and oxygen for all
           the organisms to use in respiration.
         The organisms also affect their environment. For example,
         droppings from the kangaroo rats become part of the soil.
         The gases that they take in and give out affect the composition

         The interactions in an ecosystem are usually very complicated. The
         study of ecosystems is called ecology. No ecologist would ever claim
         to have discovered all of the different interactions in an ecosystem.
         There is always something new to find out, even in an ecosystem that

        Questions
        1	 Name two producers in the diagram of a food web in the
           Sonoran Desert.
        2	 Explain why the food web could not exist without the producers.
        3	 What do the arrows in the food web represent?
        4	 Give two examples of interactions between organisms in the desert
           that are not to do with feeding.

        Habitats in a desert ecosystem
        The place where an organism naturally lives is called its habitat.
        There are many different places to live in a desert.

               The habitat of a saguaro cactus is the open desert.
               The habitat of a Gila woodpecker is a saguaro cactus (where it
               makes its nest) and the air and ground in the open desert (where
               it collects food).
               The habitat of a desert ant is underneath the rocks and soil and
               on the soil surface.
               Termites live at the base of the saguaro stems.
               Sap beetles live inside the saguaro flowers.

             Activity 4.1.2
             How a species fits into the desert ecosystem
             Work in a group of three or four for this activity.
             You are going to choose one species that lives in the desert. You could
             continue to think about the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, or you could choose
             a different desert.
             Investigate how your species interacts with other organisms, and with the
             non-living things around it. You could choose one of the species mentioned
             in this topic, or a completely different species.
