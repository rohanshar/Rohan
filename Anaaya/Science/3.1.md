**Quiz: Chapter 3.1 - Forces and Motion**

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions based on the information provided in the text and diagrams for section 3.1.

**Part 1: Definitions and Concepts**

1. What is the unit of force mentioned in the 'Getting started' section?
2. How are forces shown on diagrams according to the text? What do the arrows represent?
3. Define 'balanced forces' as described in the summary.
4. When are forces considered 'unbalanced'? (Give one condition from the summary).
5. Look at the first diagram of the rock on page 63. a) What is the name of the force pulling the rock towards the centre of the Earth? b) What is the name of the force the ground exerts upwards on the rock? c) Are these two forces balanced or unbalanced when the rock is not moving?

**Part 2: Effects of Forces**

6. What is the effect of balanced forces on the movement of an object?
7. List three specific changes in movement that unbalanced forces can cause.
8. Refer to the parachute example on page 64. a) Just after the parachute opens, why does the falling object slow down? (Describe the forces). b) What happens to the forces when the object later falls at a constant speed?
9. According to the text (page 65), what kind of force is needed to keep an object moving in a circle, and why does this cause a change in motion?
10. In the tug of war example (page 67), why is the rope not moving initially?

**Part 3: Applying Concepts**

11. Look at the diagram of the aeroplane on page 67. a) Why is the aeroplane flying at a constant speed horizontally? (Mention the relevant forces). b) Why is the aeroplane not getting higher or lower? (Mention the relevant forces).
12. Look at the diagram of the toy train moving on a circular track (page 67). Which arrow (A, B, C, or D) best represents: a) The force that keeps the train moving in a circle? b) The force of friction opposing the train's movement?
13. True or False: An object that is not moving has no forces acting on it. Explain your answer briefly based on the text.
14. If a wind blows on the rock (page 63) but the rock does not move sideways, what force balances the push from the wind?
15. When a large vehicle pushes the rock (page 63) with a force larger than friction: a) Are the sideways forces balanced or unbalanced? b) In which direction will the rock start to move?

**Answer Key**

1. The unit of force mentioned is the Newton (though not explicitly defined in 3.1, it's implied by the use of 'newton meter' in Activity 3.1.1 and common knowledge assumed in 'Getting Started'). _Self-correction: The text itself doesn't explicitly state the unit in section 3.1, but asks "What is the unit of force?" in the 'Getting Started' section. The later activities use Newton meters. A precise answer based ONLY on 3.1 text is difficult, but the context strongly implies Newtons._ **Revised Answer:** The text asks this question in 'Getting Started' but doesn't explicitly state the answer within the main body of section 3.1. Later activities (e.g., 3.1.1, 3.4) refer to Newton meters, implying the unit is the Newton.   
    
2. Forces are shown using arrows. The arrows show the size (longer arrow = bigger force) and direction of each force.  
    
3. Balanced forces are equal in size and opposite in direction.   
    
4. Forces are unbalanced when they are not equal in size OR not opposite in direction (or both).
5. a) Weight (or force of gravity) b) Contact force c) Balanced
6. Balanced forces cause no change in movement (an object stays stationary or continues moving at a constant speed in a straight line).   
    
7. Speeding up, slowing down, changing direction.
8. a) The upward force of air resistance becomes larger than the downward force of weight. This unbalanced upward force causes the object to slow down. b) The forces become balanced again (air resistance decreases as speed decreases, until it equals weight).
9. A constant, unbalanced force (gravity from the Sun) is needed. This force causes the planet's direction to constantly change, keeping it in orbit.
10. The rope is not moving because the forces exerted by Team A and Team B are balanced (equal in size and opposite in direction).   
    
11. a) Because the forward 'thrust' force is equal in size and opposite in direction to the backward 'drag' force. The horizontal forces are balanced. b) Because the upward 'lift' force is equal in size and opposite in direction to the downward 'weight' force. The vertical forces are balanced.
12. a) C (This force points towards the centre of the circle) b) B (This force opposes the direction of movement)
13. False. An object that is not moving can still have forces acting on it, but these forces are balanced (e.g., weight and contact force on the rock).
14. Friction between the rock and the ground.
15. a) Unbalanced. b) In the direction of the larger sideways force (the push from the vehicle).
