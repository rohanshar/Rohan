               Introduction
        Welcome to Stage 8 of Cambridge International Lower Secondary Science.
        We hope this book will show you how interesting and exciting science can be.
        Science is everywhere. Everyone uses science every day. Can you think of
        examples of science that you have seen or used today?
        Have you ever wondered about any of these questions?




                                             E
        •	   What am I made of ?
        •	   Where do all the dead plants, animals and their waste disappear to?
        •	   Why does frozen water behave differently to liquid water?
        •	   What happens in a chemical reaction?
        •	
        •	
             What is electricity?


                                           PL
             How did the planets form around the Sun?
        You will work like a scientist to find answers to these questions and more. It
        is good to talk about science as you investigate and learn. You will share your
        ideas with classmates to help them understand, and listen to them when you
        need reassurance. You will reflect on what you did and how you did it, and
        ask yourself: ‘would I do things differently next time?’
                       M
        You will practise new skills and techniques, check your
        progress, and challenge yourself to find out more.
        You will make connections between the different
        sciences, and how they link to maths, English and
        other subjects.
        We hope you enjoy thinking and working like

            Making better measurements
            In Science, we often take measurements. We do this to find out more about
            something that we are interested in.
            Measurements are taken using measuring instruments. These include rulers,
            Laboratory        apparatus
            balances, timers and so on.
            We want our measurements to be as accurate as possible. In other words, we
            want them to be as close as possible to the true answer. Then we can be more
            confident that our conclusions are correct.

            Measuring instruments
            How can we be sure that our measurements are as accurate as possible?

            We need to think about the instruments we use. Here are two examples:
            •	     You want to measure a 50 cm3 volume of water. It is better to use a 100 cm3
                   measuring cylinder than a 50 cm3 beaker, even though the beaker may have
                   a line indicating the level which corresponds to 50 cm3. A 100 cm3 measuring
                   cylinder is better than one which measures 1000 cm3 because 50 cm3 is only
                   a small fraction of 1000 cm3.
                   You want to time a toy car moving a distance of 1.0 m. You could use the clock
                   on the wall, but this is not a good choice as it is not accurate. You could use a
                   stopwatch, but it is tricky to start and stop the watch at the exact moments when
                         M
                   the car crosses the starting and finishing lines. You would have to take account of
                   your reaction time. It is best to use light gates since these automatically start and
                   stop as the car passes through. The gates are connected to a timer which will show
                   you the time taken to within a fraction of a second.

                                                                             light gate

             We also need to think about how we use measuring instruments.
             For example:
             •	When using a ruler to measure the length of an object, the ruler
               needs to be placed directly alongside the object. Make sure that
             Laboratory
               one end of theapparatus
                              object is exactly next to the zero of the ruler’s scale.

                           Don’t do it like this. You might think the end of the leaf stalk is at
                           0 cm but it is actually at 0.2 cm.

                  When using a measuring cylinder, look horizontally at the surface
                  of the liquid and read the scale level with the bottom of the meniscus.


                                                                                meniscus

                            read as 45.

             •	   When using a balance to weigh an object, check that it reads zero
                  when there is nothing on it. Similarly, a forcemeter should read zero
                  when no force is pulling on it. It may be possible to reset these
                  instruments if they are not correctly set to zero.




                           Don’t use it like this.

            Improving accuracy
            You can see that to make your measurements as accurate as possible, you need to think
            carefully about the measuring instruments you use and how you use them.
            It can help to make repeat measurements; measure the same quantity several times and
            then to calculate the average.
            With practice, you will find that your measurements become more accurate and so you
            will be able to trust your findings more.

            Paula thought that one of her results didn’t look right. Can you spot which one it is?
            A result like this, that does not fit the pattern of all the other results, is called
            an anomalous result.
SA

            If you get something that looks like an anomalous result, there are two things that you
            can do.
            1 	 The best thing to do is to try to measure it again.
            2 	 If you can’t do that, then you should ignore the result. So Paula should not use this
                result when she is calculating the mean. She should use only the other two results for
                that distance from the lamp, add them up and divide them by two.
            Spotting an anomalous result in a results table can be quite difficult. It is often much easier
            if you have drawn a graph.
            Arun did an experiment to investigate how adding ice to water changed its temperature.
            He added a cube of ice to 500 cm3 of water and stirred the water until the ice had completely
            melted. Then he measured the temperature of the water before adding another ice cube.
            The graph on the next page shows his results.

            speed	         ​​  distance
                         = _______      ​​ 
                                 time
            distance	 = speed × time

                           ​​  distance




                                                E
            time	        = _______      ​​ 
                                 time
            How can you remember these three equations? It will help if you think about
            the meaning of each quantity involved. It can also help to think about the units
            of each quantity.




                                              PL
            Speed is the distance travelled per second or per hour. The word ‘per’ means ‘in each’,
            and this should remind you that the distance must be divided by the time.
            Another way to think of this is to start with the units. Speed is measured in metres
            per second, so you must take the number of metres (the distance) and divide by the
            number of seconds (the time).
            Distance is how far you travel. The faster you go (the greater your speed), and the
            longer you go for (the greater the time), the greater the distance travelled. This tells
            us that the two quantities must be multiplied together.

        Why we need oxygen
        You may remember that one of the characteristics shared
        by all living things is respiration. Respiration is a series of
        chemical reactions that happens inside every living cell.
        The kind of respiration that usually happens inside our cells
        is called aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration uses oxygen.
        The cells produce carbon dioxide as a waste product.
        The air around you contains oxygen. When you breathe,




                                             E
        you take air into your lungs. Some of the oxygen from the
        air goes into your blood. The blood delivers the oxygen
        to every cell in the body, so that the cells can use it for
        respiration. The blood collects the waste carbon dioxide
        from the cells, and takes it back to the lungs.




                                           PL
        The organs that help you to take oxygen out of the air, and
        get rid of carbon dioxide, make up the respiratory system.
        Can you name any of the other organs shown in the picture?

         1 Respiration


         Questions
         1	 Put your finger on the entrance to the nose or mouth in the diagram
            of the respiratory system. Move your finger along the white space
            and down into the lungs.
              Write down the structures that the air passes through, as it moves
              down into your lungs. Write them in the correct order.
         2	 Now write the same structures in the order in which air passes through
            them as it moves out of your lungs and back into your surroundings.
         Air gets into your body through your mouth or nose. Your mouth and nose




                                             E
         both connect to your trachea. The trachea is sometimes called the windpipe.
         It has strong rings of cartilage around it. These rings of cartilage keep the
         trachea open and prevent it collapsing so that air can be kept moving in
         and out of your body. If you put your fingers on the front of your neck and




                                           PL
         move them downwards, you can feel the rings of cartilage on your trachea.
         The trachea branches into two bronchi (singular: bronchus). The bronchi
         also have cartilage to support them. One bronchus goes to each lung.
         Each bronchus carries air deep into the lungs. Each bronchus divides
         into several smaller tubes called bronchioles. These structure of these
         branches allow the air to reach deeper into the lungs.
         The bronchioles end by branching into many tiny structures called
         air sacs. This is where the oxygen goes into the blood, and the carbon
         dioxide comes out. You can find out more about this in the next topic.

           Think about how you will reduce or overcome any risks. be prepared to share your ideas.

              You will need:
              •	 a set of lungs from an animal, such as a sheep or goat (from a butcher)
              •	 a big board to put the lungs onto
              •	 hot water, soap and towels to wash your hands after handling the lungs

           Questions
           1	 Describe what the lungs look like.
                If you prefer, you could make a labelled drawing instead of writing about them.

          Activity 1.1.1
          What does the larynx do?
          Hold the fingertips of one hand against your larynx (voicebox).
          Keep your lips together, and make a loud humming sound.
          Can you feel the larynx vibrating?
SA

          Your larynx contains your vocal cords. These are bands of muscle that stretch across your
          larynx. You can think of them as being rather like guitar strings. When these cords vibrate,
          they make a sound.
          Now make a higher-pitched humming sound. Then try a really deep pitched one.
          Can you feel the larynx changing when you make the different sounds?


          Summary checklist
            	    I can name the parts of the respiratory system, and identify them on a diagram.
            	    I can list the organs that air passes through, as it moves into and out of the lungs.

        Air sacs
        The photograph shows a tiny part of the lungs, seen through a powerful
        microscope. You can see the lungs are mostly holes. These holes are
        called air sacs. Another name for them is alveoli.
        There are also lots of very tiny blood vessels in the lungs, wrapped
        around the air sacs. You cannot see them in the photograph, but they
        are shown in the diagram below. These blood vessels are capillaries.

        You can see that there is a blood capillary around the outside of the
        alveolus. The capillary is pressed tightly against the alveolus. The wall
        of the capillary is also made of a single layer of very thin cells.

         1 Respiration


         Gas exchange in the air sacs
         Inside the air sacs, oxygen from the air goes into the blood. Carbon
         dioxide from the blood goes into the air. This is called gas exchange.
         Think about the blood capillary on the left of the diagram. The blood
         inside this capillary comes from the heart. Before reaching the heart,
         it came from the organs in the body. These organs contain cells that
         respire, using up oxygen and making carbon dioxide. So, the blood in
         this capillary contains only a small amount of oxygen, and a lot of
         carbon dioxide.




                                             E
         Now think about the air inside the air sac. It came from outside the
         body, where the air contains a lot of oxygen and only a small amount of
         carbon dioxide.
         Inside the alveolus, this air is very close to the blood. There are only two




                                           PL
         very thin cells between the air and the blood.
         The oxygen particles in the air are a gas, so they are moving freely. They
         can easily move from the air, through these thin walled cells and into the
         blood. This is called diffusion. You can find out more about diffusion
         in Topic 3.7. The oxygen molecules move from where there are a lot of
         them (in the air) to where there are fewer of them (in the blood).
         When the oxygen gets into the blood, it dissolves. (You can find out
         about dissolving in Topic 2.1.) It goes into the red blood cells where it
         combines with haemoglobin. You will find out what happens to it after
                       M
         that in Topic 1.6.
         Now think about the carbon dioxide. There is a lot of it in the blood in
         the capillary, and only a small quantity in the air inside the air sac. So,
         the carbon dioxide diffuses into the air in the air sac.

          Think like a scientist

          Why are air sacs so small?
          In this activity, you will use some agar jelly to represent the lungs, and some coloured
          liquid to represent oxygen in the air.

              You will need:
              • two Petri dishes filled with agar jelly




                                             E
              • two cork-borers, one with a diameter of 10 mm and the other with a diameter of 5 mm
              • some coloured dye        • a dropper pipette

          3                                PL
                Use the larger cork-borer to make eight holes in the jelly in
                one of the dishes. Space the holes evenly in the dish.
                Now use the smaller cork-borer to make 32 holes in the jelly
                in the other dish. Try to space the holes evenly in the dish.
                Using the dropper pipette, carefully fill each hole in both
                dishes with the coloured dye. Try to put the same quantity
                of dye into each hole. It’s really important not to get any
                dye on the jelly!

          4     Leave both dishes for at least 15 minutes.

          6     After 15 minutes (or a little bit longer if things are happening slowly)
                record your observations.
          Questions
SA

          1     The holes that you made in the jelly represent the air sacs in
                the lungs. The coloured dye represents oxygen in the air sacs.
                The holes in the jelly are an analogy for the air sacs, and the
                dye is an analogy for oxygen.
                Explain how your observations help to show what happens to oxygen in the lungs.
          2     The total volume of the 32 small holes is the same as the total volume of the eight
                large holes. Use your observations to suggest why it is better to have a lot of very
                small air sacs in the lungs, rather than just a few large ones.
          3     Do you think that the agar jelly with holes is a good model for what happens in
                the lungs? Explain your answer.

           Comparing the carbon dioxide content of inspired air and expired air
           In this activity, you will use limewater to compare how much carbon dioxide there
           is in the air that you breathe in and the air that you breathe out.
           Work with a partner to do this activity.

               You will need:
               • rubber tubing      • glass tubing as shown in the diagram




                                             E

           It is very important that the rubber tubing is perfectly
           clean before you use it. Do not share the mouthpiece
           with anyone else or put it on the work surface when
           you have finished.

                assessment of all the risks and decide how
                you will overcome or reduce these risks.

                What is different about the glass tubing that goes into test tube A and test tube B?
           3    Now think about what might happen if you gently blow down the rubber tube.
SA

                Predict the tube in which you think bubbles will appear. Why do you think that?
           4    Gently blow into the rubber tubing, until bubbles appear in one of the tubes.
                Was your prediction correct?
           5    Now think about what might happen if you gently suck the rubber tube. Try it.
                Was your prediction correct?
           6    Put your mouth over the end of the rubber tubing, and gently breathe in and out.
                Bubbles will appear in one tube as you breathe out, and in the other tube as you breathe in.
                Your partner will check the bubbles and can tell you if you are doing it correctly.
                Be careful – don't suck too hard! Limewater is not poisonous, but it is not a good
                idea to get it into your mouth.
           7    Continue until the limewater in one of the tubes has gone cloudy. Make a note of
                which tube it is.

           Measuring the volume of air you can push out of your lungs
           How much air do you think you can push out of your lungs in one breath?
           In this experiment, you will use some very simple apparatus to find out.

              You will need:




                                             E
              • a big plastic bottle with a lid  • measuring cylinder  • bendy tubing 
              • marker pen  • water  • big bowl

           Safety




           Method
                                           PL
           The bottle and bendy tubing must be clean, and the water you use must be safe to drink.
           You may get water on the floor as you do your experiment. Take care not to slip in it.


           1	 You are going to use the plastic bottle to measure volumes.
                In your group of three, discuss how you can use the measuring cylinder to mark
                a scale on the plastic bottle.
                       M
                Then mark the scale on the bottle. The scale should go all the way from the
                bottom to the top of the bottle.
           2	 Fill the bottle right to the top with water. Put the lid on.
           3	 Pour water into the big bowl until it is about half full.
              Turn the bottle upside down, and hold it in the bowl.
              Very carefully take the lid off the bottle. You should find
SA

              that all the water stays in the bottle.
           4	 Carefully slide the bendy tubing into the top of the
              bottle, under water.
           5	 Take a deep breath in, then put your mouth over the
              tubing and breathe out as much air as you can through
              the tubing. Your expired air will push out some water
              from the bottle.
                Use the scale that you drew on the bottle to record the
                volume of air you breathed out.
           6	 If you have time, repeat steps 2 to 5 two more times. Use your three results to
              calculate a mean value for the volume of air you can breathe out of your lungs.

          7	 Replace the tubing with another piece of clean tubing. Now another person
             in your group can try the experiment.
          8	 Record all of your results in a table.
          Questions
          1	 Share your results with the rest of the class. Can you see any patterns in the results?
             For example:




                                             E
               •	 Do you think that the volume of air a person can breathe out is related to their size?
               •	 If there is anyone in your class who plays a wind instrument, does this seem to
                  have an effect on how much air they can breathe out?
          2	 Plan an experiment to investigate this hypothesis:




                                           PL
                 People who play the trombone can breathe out more air in one breath than people
                 who play the violin.

          Activity 1.3.1

          What happens when you breathe in?
          Sit quietly for a moment. Shut your eyes and think about your breathing.
          Put a hand just underneath your ribs. Take a deep breath in. You may be able to
          feel your ribs moving upwards. You might also be able to feel something moving
          inwards as you breathe.




                                                                                                                     15to publication.

         1 Respiration



         Breathing
         Look at the diagrams of the human respiratory system, in Topic 11.1. Find
         the ribs, and the intercostal muscles between them. Find the diaphragm.

         Remember that air is a gas. The pressure of a gas increases when the
         volume of its container is decreased. You can find more about pressure
         in Topic 3.6 Pressure in liquids and gases.

         When you breathe in, these things happen:                                                  air moves into lungs




                                             E
         •	 The intercostal muscles between the ribs
            contract (get shorter). This pulls the ribs
            upwards and outwards.
         •	 The muscles in the diaphragm contract. This
            pulls the diaphragm downwards.

         •	 These two movements make more space
            inside the chest cavity. They increase the

         •	 When the volume increases, the pressure
            inside the chest cavity and lungs decreases.
         •	 Air moves down through the trachea into the
            lungs, to fill the extra space.
                       M
         When you breathe out, these things happen:                                                  air moves out of lungs

         •	 The intercostal muscles between the ribs relax
            (return to normal size). This allow the ribs to
SA

            drop down into their natural position.
         •	 The muscles in the diaphragm relax. This
            allows the diaphragm to become its normal,
            domed shape.
         •	 These two movements make less space inside
            the chest cavity. They decrease the volume
            inside it.
         •	 When the volume decreases, the pressure
            increases. So air is squeezed out of the lungs.

         Using energy to stay alive
         Our bodies need energy for many different reasons. For example:




                                             E
          We use energy when we                  We use energy to send                  We use energy to keep our
          move around.                           electrical impulses along              bodies warm when it is cold.

                                           PL
         All of our energy comes from the food that we eat. Carbohydrates are
         especially good for giving us energy.
         When we eat food containing carbohydrates, our digestive system breaks
         the carbohydrates down to a kind of sugar called glucose. The glucose
         goes into our blood. The blood delivers glucose to every cell in the body.
         The cells use the glucose to get the energy that they need.

         Releasing energy from glucose
                       M
         Energy must be changed from one type to another, or be transferred,
         in order to do something.
         The energy in glucose is locked up inside it. Glucose is an energy
         store. Before your cells can use the energy, it has to be released from
         the glucose.

         This is done by tiny structures called mitochondria that are found                           glucose         oxygen
         inside cells. Most cells have many mitochondria inside them.
         Mitochondria release energy from glucose, so that the cells can
         use the energy.
         The mitochondria carry out a chemical reaction called aerobic                                              energy
         respiration. Aerobic means that is uses oxygen, from the air.                                              released
         Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration:
                          glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water
         In this reaction, some of the energy inside the glucose is released.                          water      carbon dioxide
         This is done in a very controlled way. Just a little bit of energy is
                                                                                            A cell with a mitochondrion inside
         released at a time – just enough for the cell’s needs.

        Questions
        1	 Neurones contain more mitochondria than cheek cells. Suggest why.
        2	 Look at the word equation for aerobic respiration.
            a	 What are the reactants in this reaction?
            b	 What are the products of this reaction?
        3	 Use the equation for aerobic respiration to explain why the air that
           you breathe out contains more carbon dioxide than the air that you
           breathe in.




                                             E
        Respiration and heat production
        In Stage 7, you learned that every time energy is transferred, or
        transformed, some of it is changed to heat energy.




                                           PL
        In respiration, chemical energy stored in glucose is transferred to other
        substances, so that cells can use it. In this process, some of the energy
        is changed to heat energy. So respiring cells get a little bit warmer than
        their surroundings.

          Think like a scientist

          Investigating respiration in peas
                       M
          All living things need energy. So all living things respire. Even seeds respire.
          Seeds respire especially quickly when they are germinating, because they need a lot of
          energy to do this. You can make pea seeds start to germinate by soaking them in water
          for about an hour.

          Explaining the difference between breathing and respiration
          Many people who have not studied science think that respiration and breathing mean the
          same thing.
          In your group of three, think about the meanings of these two words. (Look at Topic 1.3
          to remind yourself about breathing.) Think of a good way of explaining the differences
                       M
          between respiration and breathing, to someone else.

         1 Respiration



         In the activity, you had to work out for yourself how to
         explain the difference between breathing and respiration.
         Do you think this helped you to understand the difference
         yourself? Or would it have been better just to be told the
         difference by your teacher?

         1 Respiration



         Delivering the requirements for
         respiration in cells
         You have seen that all of your cells need energy to stay alive. Each cell
         gets its energy through a chemical reaction called respiration.
         Aerobic respiration happens inside the mitochondria in the cells.
         The reactants are glucose and oxygen:
                          glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water




                                               E
         So, every cell in your body needs a good supply of glucose and oxygen,
         and the carbon dioxide and water that the cell makes must be taken
         away. The delivery and removal is done by the blood.
         The blood moves around the body inside blood vessels. The heart pumps




                                             PL
         constantly, to keep the blood moving.


         What is blood?
         Everyone knows that blood is a red liquid. But if you are able to
         look at some blood through a microscope, you may get a surprise.
         The photograph shows what you might see.

        You will remember that carbon dioxide is produced in every body cell,

        Stage 7, Topic 1.3 described how the structure of red blood cells is
        related to their function. Now you are going to think about this in a
        little bit more detail.
        Red blood cells are very unusual cells. They do not have nuclei and
        they do not have mitochondria. They are full of a red pigment
        called haemoglobin. It is haemoglobin that makes blood look red.

         The haemoglobin helps the red blood cells to transport oxygen.
         •	   As the blood flows through the tiny capillaries next to the alveoli in
              the lungs, oxygen from the air diffuses into the blood, and into the
              red blood cells.
         •	   Inside the red blood cell, the oxygen combines with haemoglobin.
              It forms a very bright red compound called oxyhaemoglobin.
         •	   As the blood continues on its journey around the body, it passes cells
              that are respiring. The oxyhaemoglobin lets go of its oxygen and
              gives it to the cells.

         •	   The blood, which has given away most of its oxygen, now travels
              back to the lungs to collect some more.
         This explains why red blood cells have haemoglobin – but why don’t they
         have nuclei or mitochondria? Scientists think that not having a nucleus




                                           PL
         makes more space for haemoglobin. They also think that not having
         mitochondria stops the red blood cells from using up all the oxygen for
         themselves, instead of delivering it elsewhere.

        they can get really close to the alveoli in the lungs, and to the respiring

        3	 Explain why red blood cells might use up oxygen, if they have

        White blood cells
        White blood cells are easy to distinguish from red blood cells. They

        always have nuclei, which red blood cells do not have. Some kinds
        of white blood cell – but not all – are larger than red blood cells.
        Some bacteria and viruses can cause illness when they get into the body.
        These bacteria and viruses are called pathogens. White blood cells help
        to defend us against pathogens.




                                                  PL
        Some kinds of white blood cell can change their shape, and
        push their cytoplasm out to make ‘fingers’ that can capture a
        bacterium. The white blood cell then produces chemicals that
        kill and digest the bacterium. This is called phagocytosis.
        Other types of white blood cell produce chemicals that kill pathogens.
        These chemicals are called antibodies. They are shown as little
        Y-shapes on the diagram below. Different kinds of antibodies are
        needed for each different kind of pathogen.
                                                                                            bacterium

                         M
        The antibodies stick onto the pathogen. Sometimes, they kill the
        pathogen directly. Sometimes, they glue lots of the pathogens together
        so that they cannot move. This makes it easy for other white blood cells
        to capture and kill the pathogens.

                                          3   Sometimes, the antibodies simply kill
                                              the bacteria. Sometimes, they stick
                                              them together so that other white
                                              blood cells can come and kill them.

          discoveries can help people all over the world.
          Background
          Our white blood cells are amazing at keeping us safe from pathogens. Most of the time,
          they manage to destroy the pathogens so that we recover quickly from an infection.
          But there are some pathogens that white blood cells cannot destroy in time. The virus that
          causes rabies is one of these. If the rabies virus gets into a person’s body, the body needs

          they are infected with the rabies virus.

        What is a solution?
        When you place a lump of sugar in water, the sugar seems gradually to
        disappear. The sugar is dissolving. You are left with a colourless solution.
        The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that it
        dissolves into is called the solvent.
        A solution is a mixture. So, in our example, the colourless solution is a
        mixture of sugar and water. Although the sugar seems to disappear, it is
        still there. The sugar particles have simply spread out among the water
        particles.




                                              E
        Sugar is the
        solute.
                             Water is the
                             solvent.

                                               added to the water, the

        The diagrams below show what happens to the sugar particles when the
        cube dissolves.
                                                                              When the sugar has dissolved,

         2 Properties of materials


         All solutions are transparent. This means you can see through them.
         Transparent doesn’t mean colourless. For example, if you dissolve a
         coloured salt, such as copper sulfate, the solution formed is blue.
         But you can still see through it. It is still transparent.
         A liquid such as milk is not transparent. You cannot see through it.
         It is opaque. Because of this, you can tell that milk is not a solution.

         Copper sulfate forms a solution. It is transparent.	            Milk is not a solution. You can tell this because it is opaque.


         It is easy to confuse melting with dissolving. Remember: dissolving
         needs two substances, a solute and a solvent.

        When salt is added to water and it dissolves, it has not disappeared.
        The salt particles are still in the water. The mass of the solution equals
        the total mass of the solute and solvent. This is true for any solution.
                       mass of solute + mass of solvent = mass of solution
        No mass has been lost. The mass has been conserved.

        Solubility
        A solid that dissolves in a solvent such as water is said to be soluble.
        Sodium chloride (common salt) and sugar are soluble.
        A solid that will not dissolve in water is insoluble. Iron filings are
        insoluble in water.
        If you keep adding a soluble solid to a beaker of water, there comes
        a point where no more of the solid will dissolve. You have made a
        saturated solution.

         2 Properties of materials


         Some soluble substances are more soluble than others. If you have
         100 cm3 of water, you would be able to dissolve a lot of sodium chloride
         in it, but only a tiny amount of lead chloride. Sodium chloride has
         greater solubility than lead chloride.

           3    In this investigation you used the number of spatulas as a measure of the quantity
                of solute added. Suggest another way of measuring the amount of solute used, to
                improve the accuracy of the results.

        Comparing solubility
        To compare the solubility of different solutes you must measure how
        much of each solute will dissolve in a known amount of the solvent.
        The table shows the solubility of different salts. It shows how much of
        each salt can be dissolved when it is added to 100 g of water at 20 °C.

        Temperature and solubility
SA

        Most solutes will dissolve more quickly and easily in hot water than in
        cold water. Think about what happens to the particles when they have
        more energy. The more energy the particles have, the more they vibrate
        and move.
        You can dissolve a greater mass of the solute in hot water than in the
        same volume of cold water. In other words, as the temperature increases,
        the solubility of most solutes also increases.
        For example, if you have 100 g of water at 20 °C you can dissolve 204 g
        of sugar in it. If you heat the water to 80 °C, you can dissolve 362 g of
        sugar in it.

           b	 How much sugar will dissolve in 50 g of water at 20 °C?

           Answer




                                             E
           a	 200 g of water is twice as much as 100 g, so twice as much sugar will dissolve 204 × 2 = 408 g
           b	 In 100 g water, 204 g sugar dissolves
               In 1 g water, 204 ￼ 100 g sugar dissolves = 2.04 g
               In 50 g water, 2.04 × 50 g sugar dissolves = 102 g

         Other solvents
         Water is not the only solvent. Some substances that are insoluble in
         water will dissolve in other solvents. For example, some types of oil
         paint are not soluble in water. So if you need to clean your brushes after
         you’ve used oil paint, you will need to use a solvent that the paint will
         dissolve in, such as methanol ( methylated spirits).

         Dissolving salt in water
         These students are discussing how they will investigate how temperature
         affects the amount of salt that will dissolve in water. They are trying to
         think of all the different things that could affect the results. These are
         the variables.

         1	 Which variables have the students identified?
         2	 How do you think the volume of water will affect the results if it is
            not kept the same? Explain your answer.
         The students carry out the experiment. They decide to count the number
         of spatulas of salt (sodium chloride) that will dissolve in 50 cm3 of water.
                       M
         They will repeat the experiment at different temperatures from 20 °C to
         80 °C.
         The variable they change is the temperature of the water. They will
         count the number of spatulas of salt that will dissolve. This is the
         variable that depends on the temperature of the water.
SA

         The volume of water is the variable that the students keep the same, to
         ensure that the test is fair.
         The variable you change is called the independent variable. The variable
         you measure is called the dependent variable. The variables you keep the
         same are the control variables.
         When you plot a graph of your results, the independent variable always
         goes along the horizontal axis. The dependent variable always goes up
         the vertical axis.

            •         What volume of water you will use?
            •         How you will change the temperature of the water and how you will keep it at that
                      temperature while you add the sodium chloride?
            •         What range of temperatures you will use? (The highest and lowest temperatures
                      you will use.) Remember to be practical about this.
            •         What interval between temperatures will you use? (Will you use gaps of 10 degrees
                      between temperatures, or 5 degrees?)
            •         What will you do to ensure you are safe while carrying out your investigation?

         2 Properties of materials



         Colours in ink
         Black coloured ink looks as if it is just one colour – black. In fact, it is
         a mixture of different coloured inks. You can separate out the coloured
         inks by using a technique called paper chromatography.
         Special paper, a bit like filter paper, is used.
         Look at the photograph. A small drop of black
         ink has been placed on the paper. The water
         in the beaker has soaked up into the paper.




                                             E
         As the water moves up the paper, the different
         coloured inks that make black ink separate out.
         The resulting image on the paper is called
         a chromatogram.




                                           PL
         The coloured inks separate because the water
         dissolves them. Water is the solvent. As the
         water moves up the paper, it carries the ink
         particles with it. The different kinds of ink particles are carried different
         distances before they are left behind on the paper. This is because not all
         the ink particles have the same solubility. The more soluble the ink, the
         further its particles are carried.
         In the photo, you can see the different coloured inks that make up the ink
         in three different coloured pens – green, black, and red.
                       M
SA


         Some ink is not soluble in water, such as the ink in permanent marker
         pens. To separate out the colours in these inks, you would need to use a
         different solvent, such as alcohol.

          Separating the colours in ink

              You will need:
              • chromatography paper (or filter paper)           • beaker • water         • pencil and ruler
              • glass rod or wooden spill       • ink (pipette needed if it is liquid ink)or a pen
              • various other inks and/or food dyes

          Method
          1    Take a strip of chromatography paper. Draw a pencil line about 1 cm from the end.

               Dry the spot and then add a little more ink.
               ace about 2 cm depth of water in a beaker.
               Hang the paper over a glass rod, pencil or wooden spill so that the end with the ink
               spot is just in the water. Make sure the ink spot stays above the level of the water.
               Watch what happens as the water moves up the strip of paper.

          7    Remove the strip of paper before the water reaches the top.
               You need to be careful as the wet paper can tear easily.
SA

          8    Allow the strip to dry and then stick it in your book. This is your chromatogram.
          You can try this with all sorts of coloured liquids. Different inks and food dyes,
          especially from sweets or fruit syrup, are very good. You could also try this with
          permanent marker pens that have ink that is not soluble in water.
          Questions
          1    Why did you use a line drawn in pencil on the paper?
          2    Why was it important not to let the ink spot go under the water?
          3    Why was it important to remove the strip of paper before the water level
               reached the end of the strip?

         When comparing different substances, a scientist may use a large piece

         each other. The scientist will allow the solvent to move up through all
         the samples at the same time. To do this, the paper needs to be placed

         Scientists use chromatography to study the dyes used in food. Some
         food dyes contain only one substance; they are a pure substance. Other
         dyes contain a mixture of substances. It is important to know exactly
         what is being used when our food is processed – we need to know if any
         substances could be a health risk; for example, they could be toxic or
         cause allergic reactions.

           Project: The secret formula
           This project is to show how scientists work together and share their ideas.
           In this task, just like research scientists, you can only use the information
           available and make deductions. As you share your ideas, you will think
           about the information in different ways and then develop a theory and
           suggest more investigations.

              You will need:




                                             E
              • 4 × black pens       • a solution of the ink from the notes


           Professor Sneeze has been working on a new medicine that will protect
           people from coughs and colds. If this medicine works it will save a lot of




                                           PL
           people from feeling ill and taking time off work or school. It will also make
           him famous and make a lot of money for the university.
           Unfortunately, news that he has produced the medicine has reached some
           people who want to steal the formula, sell it to a company that will make
           the medicine and make themselves rich.
           While he is working in his laboratory, a note is delivered to Professor
           Sneeze asking him to meet Professor Clean in her laboratory at       as she
           has an interesting experiment that will finish at that time and may help
           him in his work. Just before    he goes off to Professor Clean’s laboratory.
                       M
           When he arrives, Professor Clean is pleased to see him but has no idea
           why he has come. She did not send the note.



                Dear Professor Sneeze,
SA

                I have an experiment due to finish today. I think you will be very interested to
                see the results as they may help you to improve the way your new medicine can
                be produced. Please come to my laboratory at 11.00 am when the experiment will
                have finished and we can discuss the results.
                Best wishes,
                Professor Clean


           By the time Professor Sneeze gets back to his laboratory, the equipment
           has been damaged and the formula has been stolen.

          Your task
          Your group are going to help the professor try to find out who wrote
          the note. Ink from the note has been dissolved in water and given to
          you as a solution. Choose the equipment you will need and produce
          a chromatogram to show the different components in the ink.
          The professor has borrowed pens from the four most likely suspects.
          Doctor Price: pen A; Doctor May: pen B; Doctor Burns: pen C and

        Balanced or unbalanced?
        Look at any object that is not moving.
        You may think that if an object is not moving, no
        forces are acting to push, pull or twist it. This is not
        true.
        Look at the rock in the picture. The force of gravity
        is pulling it toward the centre of the Earth. This force
        is called its weight. The rock does not move toward                                             contact force

        the centre of the Earth because the ground is pushing
        up on the rock. This force is the contact force.
        These two forces are balanced. This means the forces                                                         rock
        are equal in size and opposite in direction.

        There could be more than two forces acting on

        Imagine the wind is blowing. The wind will push
        the rock from one side.
        Why does the rock not move sideways? The pushing
        force from the wind is balanced by friction between
        the rock and the ground.
        These forces can be shown in a force diagrams. In a
                                                                            on the rock.

                                                                            The force diagram shows the balanced forces acting

         The rock will now move because the sideways forces are not balanced.
         This can be shown on the force diagram.
         The rock will now start to move in the direction of the larger
         sideways force.
         The rock will not move up or down because the forces acting up and
         down are still balanced.

         Unbalanced or unequal forces can also make moving objects slow down.
         A parachute makes a falling object slow down.
         When an object is falling quickly, the parachute causes a force of air
         resistance that is larger than the weight of the object.

           When the parachute first opens, the forces                When the object slows, the air resistance
           are unbalanced. This unbalanced force                     decreases, so the forces become balanced

        Changing direction
        Unbalanced forces can also make objects change direction.
        This tennis ball will change direction because of an unbalanced force.
        When the ball contacts the tennis racket, the ball pushes on the tennis
        racket. To make the ball go back in the opposite direction, the hitting
        force must be larger than the force from the ball.
        This can be shown in a force diagram.

         3 Forces and energy


         Summary
         •	   When forces are equal in size and opposite in direction, the forces
              are balanced.
         •	   Balanced forces cause no change in movement.
         •	   When forces are not equal in size and/or act in directions that are
              not opposite, the forces are unbalanced.
         •	   Unbalanced forces cause change in movement: speeding up, slowing
              down or changing direction.

         3 Forces and energy



           Activity 3.1.1
           Balanced or unbalanced forces?
           On a large piece of paper, draw a table with two columns: one for balanced forces and
           one for unbalanced forces.
           Put each of these situations into the correct column, according to the forces that are acting.
           The situations are:
           •    a motorcycle going around a corner
           •




                                                                                E
                a boy on a skateboard slowing down
           •    a bowling ball rolling at constant speed in a straight line
           •    a girl on a swing getting faster
           •    a computer sitting on a desk
           •
           •
                a helicopter going straight upwards at a constant speed
                a coconut falling from a tree and getting faster.


         How did you decide which situations had balanced forces and which
         had unbalanced forces?
         Did your strategy work?
         Could you use this strategy again, or would you change it?
                                                                              PL

        There are many different units of speed. Different units are sometimes
        used in different countries and for different things. For example, the
        speed of ships is often measured in knots, whereas aeroplanes often use

         3 Forces and energy


         So, to avoid confusion, scientists use standard units for measurement in
         all countries.
         The standard unit for speed is metres per second.
         The word per means ‘in each’. Therefore, metres per second means the
         number of metres travelled in each second. For example, a horse running
         with a speed of 15 metres per second means the horse travels a distance
         of 15 metres in each second.
         Metres per second is written as m/s.




                                             E
         Calculating speed
         The way you calculate speed is linked to the unit metres per second, m/s.
         For example, think of a bus that travels a distance of 100 m in a time of 20 s.

         each 1 s?


                                           PL
         The bus has travelled 100 m in 20 s, so how many metres does it travel in

                number of metres travelled in each second = _________________

         You can summarise this equation for speed as:


                                                 ​​  distance
                                         speed = _______      ​​ 
                                                       time


         Note: the term average speed is sometimes used because the speed of
         an object during a journey is not always constant. Constant means not
         changing. Average speed is calculated in exactly the same way as speed.
         The equation for speed can be used in a formula triangle. This means
         you can also use the equation to calculate:
         •	   the distance travelled, if you know the speed and the time taken
         •	   the time taken, if you know the speed and the distance travelled.

        if you have a distance in km and a time in hours, the equation will give you

        Distance–time graphs
        Scientists use graphs to describe how two variables are related.
        We can use graphs to describe the movement of an object.
        One way to do this is to plot distance travelled on the vertical axis and
        time on the horizontal axis.
        A graph like this is called a distance–time graph.
        Graphs are more useful than words for describing movement because:
        •	   it is easier to see trends and patterns




                                              E
        •	   you can read any value of distance or time during the journey,
             from the graph
        •	   other values, such as speed, can be calculated from a graph

             information about the whole journey can be seen easily.
        This is a distance–time graph. It shows the journey of a car from a
        starting position A to a destination, C. The car then returns to its

        Now take a closer look at what the graph shows in each of the four
        sections. These sections are in different colours so you can see
        them clearly.
        1	 At the starting position, A, the object has travelled zero distance.
           The car travels at a constant speed away from the starting position
           to point B. When moving at constant speed, the car travels the
           same distance in each second. The distance from the start increases
           with time. The distance–time graph show this as a straight, upward
           sloping line.
        2	 The car stops at B. It is stationary. Stationary means not moving,
           with a speed of zero. You can also use the term at rest to mean
           stationary. The distance of the car from the start position does
           not change when the object is stationary, but time still passes.
           The distance–time graph shows a straight line that is horizontal.



                                                                                                                     79to publication.

         3	 The car starts again and moves at a constant speed to its destination,
            point C. It moves faster than when it travelled between A and B,
            meaning it travels a greater distance each second. So, the distance–time
            graph show this as a steeper straight, upward sloping line.
         4	 From point C, the car travels at a constant speed back to the
            starting position, A. The distance of the object from the start will
            decrease with time. The distance–time graph shows this as a straight,
            downward sloping line.
         The distance–time graph for the car journey was a sketch. If you draw

         a sketch graph you do not have to put numbers on your graph axes.
         Sometimes, distance–time graphs have values on the axes. This means
         you can use the graph to make calculations. Read the distance from the
         vertical axis, and the time from the horizontal axis. Then use the equation:

          My journey
          Think about a journey you made recently.
          The journey could be walking or any other
          method of travel.
          The journey could be coming to school or a
          longer journey.
          Sketch a distance–time graph for that journey.

          Label your graph with what each part
          represents.
          Swap your graph with someone else.
          Can they understand your journey by looking
          at the graph?

          In this activity, you will plan an investigation, make measurements, do calculations
          and draw a distance–time graph.
          Work in groups of three or four.

            You will need:
            • space where you can run safely  • tape measure  • stopwatch

            • one sheet of graph paper per person

          Method
          You need to calculate the average speed of walking for one person in the group, in m/s.
          You then need to calculate the average speed of running for one person in the group, in m/s.
          It does not have to be the same person.
          1	 Plan what measurements you will need to make and how you will make these
             measurements.

             Turning effects of forces
             When you push down on a door handle, the handle turns.
             When you push down on the pedal of a bicycle, the pedal turns.
             When you pull on a door, the door turns toward you.
             These are all examples of forces that cause an object to turn.
             The object that turns is called a lever.
             The point around which the lever turns is called the pivot.




                                                    E
             The lever and pivot are shown in the picture of the bicycle pedals
             in Figure 3.4.1.
             When you bend your arm, the arm acts as a lever. Your elbow is the pivot.

             Calculating moments
             The moment of a force describes its the turning effect of a force.
             The moment of a force depends on:
             •	   the size of the force (the bigger the force, the bigger the moment)
             •	   the distance between the position where the force acts and the pivot
                  (the greater the distance, the greater the moment).
             You can calculate a moment from this equation:

                                         moment = force × distance

        Distance in the equation is the distance from the pivot to the position
        where the force acts.
        The unit of force is the newton and the unit of distance is the metre.
        Therefore, the unit of moment is newton × metre, which is written as
        newton metre or N m.
        Remember to use an upper case N and a lower case m when writing N m.

          the door hinges (the pivot) is 0.8 m What is the moment caused by the pull on the door?

          Answer
          moment = force × distance
                    = 35 × 0.8

         Balancing
         A seesaw is a type of lever.
         People sit on either side of the pivot of a seesaw and
         make the lever turn one way and then the other.
         The result is that each person moves up and down.
         A seesaw will be balanced when the moments on
         both sides of the pivot are equal and opposite.

          Make a prediction about what will happen to the force needed to pull the metre rule
          down as the distance between the force and the pivot decreases.
          Method
          1	 Move the loop of string with the newton meter as far from the pivot as you can.
          2	 Record the distance between the pivot and the string.
          3	 Raise the newton meter so it is not pulling down on the metre rule.




                                             E
          4	 Use the newton meter to pull down on the metre rule. The distance that you pull
             depends on the strength of the elastic band. The metre rule needs to be pulled
             down far enough to get a reading of about 1 N at the furthest point from the pivot.
          5	 Record this distance. This will be the distance you pull down on the metre rule
             each time.
          6	 Record the force.


                                           PL
          7	 Repeat this, pulling the metre rule down the same distance each time.
             Each time, use the loop of string to move the newton metre closer to the pivot.
          8	 Your results should be a set of distances and forces.
          9	 Decide whether you need to repeat any of your measurements.
          Results and questions
                       M
          1	 Describe how you made the experiment safe.
          2	 Record your results in a table. Make sure that you record distances in metres,
             so you may need to convert from cm or mm. Remember to reverse the order
             of your results, so in the table the distances are increasing.
          3	 Draw a line graph of your results. Put distance on the horizontal axis and

             force on the vertical axis.
          4	 Explain the pattern in your results.

             get more accurate results.

         3 Forces and energy



         The pushing effect of a force
         The picture shows a knife being used to cut modelling clay.

                                              PL
         What could you do if the clay was difficult to cut?


         The knife works because the force used to push down on the clay causes
         pressure on the clay.
         You can think of pressure as the pushing effect of a force.
         Suppose the clay is difficult to cut. How could you increase the pushing
         effect of the force?
         You could:
                        M
         •	   increase the force on the knife; as the force increases, the pressure
              increases
         •	   use a sharper knife (a sharp knife has less surface area in contact
              with the clay); as the area decreases, the pressure increases.
SA

         The equation linking pressure, force and area is


                                                  ​​  force
                                       pressure = ____area  ​​


         Pressure is force divided by area. The unit of force is the newton and
         the unit of area is the metre squared. That means the unit of pressure is
         newtons per metre squared, or N/m2.
         Sometimes you can use smaller areas, measured in cm2. If the area is
         in cm2 then the unit of pressure will be N/cm2. If the area was in mm2,
         what would the unit of pressure be?
         Some things have large areas to decrease pressure; others have small
         areas to increase pressure.

         The camel has large feet. This
         means the force from the weight
         of the camel is applied over a
         large area. The pressure on the
         sand is decreased, so the camel
         will not sink in the sand.

         The woman in the picture is
         lying on a bed of nails. Each nail
         has a sharp point on the end.
         The weight of the woman acts
         on many hundreds of nails, so
         the pressure from each nail is
         very small.




         The end of this pin has a sharp
         point. The sharp point has a

         small area to increase pressure.
         The increased pressure means
         the pin will easily go into wood
         or card.
SA

         Scissors have sharp blades. The
         area along the cutting edge
         of each blade is small. This
         increases the pressure, making
         things easier to cut.

        Pressure in liquids
        Look at the picture of a dam. The wall of this dam is wider at the
        bottom than it is at the top.




                                             E
                                           PL
        The water comes out with more force than from the upper gaps
                       M
        Behind the wall of the dam, the water is almost to the top of the wall.
        You can see water coming out from two levels.
        The water coming out close to the top is coming out with less force.
        The water coming out from further down is coming out with more force.
SA

        This is because pressure in the water increases with depth.
        The wall is wider at the bottom to make the wall stronger where the
        pressure from the water is greatest.

        Pressure and depth in liquids
        The pressure in a liquid increases with depth, but why?
        As you go deeper in a liquid, there is more liquid above your position.
        The weight of this liquid, caused by gravity, pushes on the particles of
        the liquid.
        When the particles of the liquid are pushed, they move with more force.
        As the particles in a liquid are moving randomly in all directions, then
        the pressure in the liquid is equal in all directions.

         3 Forces and energy



         Pressure in gases
         Before you blow up a balloon, there is a small volume
         of air inside the balloon. The balloon is open at one
         end, so the pressure of the air inside is the same as the
         pressure of the air outside.
         As you blow air into the balloon, you are adding
         more gas particles.
         Particles in a gas move randomly and collide with the




                                                  E
         walls of the container. The container is the balloon.
         Every time a gas particle collides with the wall of
         the container, the particle exerts a small force on
         the wall.




                                                PL
         The more particles there are in the gas, the more collisions happen
         with the walls, and so the force on the walls increases.
         As this force is exerted on an area, the force causes pressure.
         The pressure inside the balloon gets bigger as you blow in more air,
         pushing the walls of the balloon outwards.

         The pressure of the air in this tyre is too low.                                          causing pressure.

        The air inside the tyre is at low pressure. The pressure is not enough
        to support the weight of the vehicle.
        If more air is put inside the tyre, the pressure will increase. More
        collisions will happen with the inside walls of the tyre, pushing the
        tyre outward and supporting the vehicle.

        Pressure and depth in gases
        As with liquids, the pressure in a gas increases with depth.
        Most people on Earth live at low altitude. Altitude is height above sea level.




                                             E
        The Earth’s atmosphere, which we call air, is made from gases.
        The atmosphere extends to a height of about above sea level.
        Sea level is, therefore, where the atmosphere is at its deepest.
        So, at sea level, atmospheric pressure is highest.

        atmospheric pressure change:
        •	

        •	
             of gas particles decreases    PL
        As you go higher in the atmosphere, two variables that affect

             the number of particles in of air decreases, so the concentration

             the weight of air above your current position decreases.
        Atmospheric pressure at sea level is about . This pressure is the
        equivalent of the weight of two large elephants pushing on every of
                       M
        surface! We are not aware of the pressure from the atmosphere because
        we live in the atmosphere all the time.


        Effects of atmospheric pressure
        The effect of atmospheric pressure can be shown by pumping
SA

        the air out of a metal container.
        Before the air is pumped out, the pressure on the inside of the
        container is equal to the pressure on the outside.
        When the air is pumped out, the pressure inside the container
        becomes close to zero. The pressure on the outside does
        not change.
        The container is crushed by the pressure of the air outside
        the container. The picture shows a containercrushed by
        atmospheric pressure.

         3 Forces and energy


         Pressure and temperature in gases
         As the temperature of a gas increases, the speed of the particles in the
         gas increases.
         When particles are travelling faster, their collisions exert more force.
         This means that increasing the temperature of a gas will
         increase the pressure of the gas.
         High pressure can be used to cook food.
         The picture shows a type of cooking pot called a




                                             E
         pressure cooker.
         Water and food are placed inside the pressure cooker.
         The pressure cooker has a sealed lid. When the water
         boils, the steam cannot escape so the pressure of the
         gas inside increases.

        Mixing gases
        The particles in a gas move randomly. Both the speed of the particles
        and the direction of the particles are random.
        If we mix two gases in one container, each one will have particles that
        move randomly.
        That means each gas will spread to fill the container.
        The movement of the particles of each gas is called diffusion.
        Diffusion means the overall random movement of particles from an




                                             E
        area where they are in higher concentration to an area where they are
        in lower concentration. Concentration is the number of particles in a
        particular volume.
        Look at the diagrams. They show how two gases diffuse.

        Diffusion explains how you can smell food cooking.
        When food is heated, some particles in the food change state and
        become gas.

         The gas particles from the food move randomly
         and so spread out through the air by diffusion.
         The strength of the smell will get stronger as you
         move closer to the food. This is because the
         concentration of the particles is higher, the closer
         you get to the source of the particles.
         Many animals use this change in strength of
         smell to find food.

         Mixing liquids
         Diffusion also happens in liquids. Particles in a liquid also move at random.
         The picture shows what happens when blue ink is added to water.

         The blue ink moves from the area of high concentration to the areas of
         low concentration, until it is completely diffused throughout the water.

         Speed of diffusion
         The speed of diffusion depends on:
         •    the difference in concentration of the particles
         •    temperature.
         The bigger the difference in the concentrations of the particles, the faster
         the diffusion.
         The higher the temperature, the faster the diffusion. Higher temperature
         makes particles move faster, so the particles can spread out faster.
         For example, when you make a cup of tea, the tea diffuses through the
         water. It diffuses faster in hot water than it does in cold water.

          The effect of temperature on the speed of diffusion
          In this investigation, you will investigate how temperature affects the rate of
          diffusion in liquids.
          Work in groups of two or three.

            You will need:
            • three or more identical beakers  •  water  • a way to heat the water




                                             E
            • a way to cool the water (optional)  • water-soluble ink  • measuring cylinder
            • thermometer • dropper pipette • stopwatch

          Method




                                           PL
          1	 Add equal volumes of water at different temperatures to each of your beakers.
          2	 Measure and record the temperature of the water in each beaker.
          3	 Use the dropper pipette to carefully add a small volume of the ink to the
             bottom of each beaker. Squeeze the top of the pipette gently so the ink
             does not squirt out into the water and start mixing.
               Add the ink to the water in order from the lowest to the highest temperature.
          4	 Use a stopwatch to time diffusion process in each beaker.
                       M
          5	 Stop the stopwatch when the ink has fully spread out through the water of
             the beaker being tested.
          Questions
          1	 Describe the trend in your results.
          2	 Explain this trend.
SA

          3	 Explain why you used equal volumes of water in all the beakers.
          4	 Suggest at least two improvements to the method that would give better results.
          Peer-assessment
          Swap your answers with another group.
          You will assess their answers to 2 and 4.
          Instead of marking their answers, write some feedback to the group.

         3 Forces and energy



           Project: Making a balance for weighing
           This project is about using moments to find the weights of objects. You will make
           a balance and then use it to find some unknown weights.
           Background
           The earliest balances for weighing
           needed equal weights on both
           sides of the balance.
           The unknown weight was placed




                                             E
           on one side, and known weights
           were added on the other side until
           the system balanced.
           A system such as this is balanced
           because there are two moments
           acting.
           One moment tries to pull one
           side down.
           The other moment tries to pull
           the other side down.
           When the moments are equal
                                           PL
           and opposite, the system is balanced.
                       M
           This happens when the weights are equal because the distances from the pivot
           are also equal.
           Your task
           Make a balance that can be used to weigh a range of different weights without
           changing the known weight.
SA

           Your balance will work in a different way to the one in the picture, so yours will
           not look like this.
           Work in groups.
           You can use equipment such as:
           •    a metre rule
           •    a triangular prism
           •    a known weight
           •    any other equipment that your teacher makes available.

          Continued
          Remember:
          •    do not confuse weight with mass
          •    weight is a force
          •    the moment caused by a force depends on the distance from the pivot.
          When your balance is made and working, you can demonstrate to the class
          how it works.

        A desert in Arizona
        The photograph shows the Sonoran Desert in Arizona,
        in the USA.
        Deserts are not easy places for animals and plants to live.
        Deserts do not get much rainfall, so the organisms that live
        there must have adaptations that help them to survive with
        little water.
        The tall plants in the photograph are saguaro cacti. They grow




                                             E
        very slowly, and those in the photograph may be more than
        100 years old. Their roots spread out widely just underneath
        the soil, ready to absorb any rain that falls.
        Many animals live among the cacti and other desert plants.




                                           PL
        Gila woodpeckers make holes in the cacti, to make their
        nests. Other birds also visit these holes.
        Cactus wrens often use a different kind of cactus, called
        a teddy bear cholla, to make their nests. Teddy bear
        chollas are so spiky that very few other animals will get
        close to them. So the cactus wren’s eggs and young ones
        are protected from predators.

         4 Ecosystems


         During the hot days, lizards, tortoises and other animals
         rest in the shade of the plants, or burrow into the soil
         where it is cooler. At night, when the temperature falls,
         kangaroo rats come out to feed, wary of their predators
         such as rattlesnakes and coyotes.
         In the Sonoran Desert, it usually rains heavily at least once a
         year. When the rains come, the desert is transformed. Many
         plants quickly produce flowers.
         Insects feed on the nectar and pollen in the flowers, helping
         the plants to reproduce by pollinating them. At night, bats




                                             E
                                                                                    A kangaroo rat
         feed on nectar from the flowers of agave plants.
         Seeds fall to the ground and are collected by ants, to take
         into their nests to provide a food store. Many months or
         years later, some of the uneaten seeds may germinate to
         produce new plants.

         Interactions in the Sonoran Desert

                                           PL
         As you read the information above, and looked at the
         photographs, you may have realised that all the different
         animals and plants depend on each other. They interact
         with each other. The actions of one organism affect
         another.

          Work with a partner.

            You will need:
            • a large sheet of paper         • coloured pens
            • (optional) pictures of the animals and plants in the desert, that you can cut out

          Read the information about life in the Arizonan Sonora Desert, and look at the
          photographs. Make a list of different ways that the animals and plants interact
          with one another.

          Now think about how you could show these interactions in a picture. On a piece
          of rough paper, make a rough sketch of the design for your picture.
          Build up your picture on a large sheet of paper. You could draw pictures of the
          organisms, or stick cut-out pictures of them onto the paper. Write descriptions
          about how they interact with each other.


        Non-living things in the desert
                       M
        It is not only other organisms that affect the plants and animals
        in the Arizona desert. There are also interactions between the
        organisms and the non-living parts of their environment.
        • Light: The bright sunlight helps the plants to photosynthesise,
          producing food that other organisms can eat.
SA

        • Temperature: The temperature is often very high during the
          day, but much lower at night. Some animals are nocturnal,
          which helps them to avoid overheating or drying out. It is
          cooler underneath the soil, so some animals – such as the
          tarantula in the picture – dig burrows for shelter during
          the day.
        • Soil: Rocks and soil provide minerals for the plants to grow,
          as well as building material for ground-nesting birds.

         4 Ecosystems


         • Water: All organisms need water to keep their cells
           alive. Rain, when it comes, allows them to become
           more active and to reproduce.
         • Air: The desert air provides carbon dioxide for the
           plants to use in photosynthesis, and oxygen for all
           the organisms to use in respiration.
         The organisms also affect their environment. For example,
         droppings from the kangaroo rats become part of the soil.
         The gases that they take in and give out affect the composition

         The interactions in an ecosystem are usually very complicated. The
         study of ecosystems is called ecology. No ecologist would ever claim
         to have discovered all of the different interactions in an ecosystem.
         There is always something new to find out, even in an ecosystem that
         scientists have been studying for a long time.

         4 Ecosystems



         More about ecosystems
         The ecosystem in the Arizona Desert is just one of many different
         ecosystems on Earth. Here are three more examples of ecosystems:
         mangrove forests, sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, and a rice paddy.

         Mangrove forest
          •   Mangroves are trees that can grow with their roots
              in sea water. They form forests along the coasts of




                                             E
              many tropical countries
          •   Young fish live among the mangrove roots, safe
              from larger fish that might eat them. Mud skippers
              climb out onto the mud when the tide is out,

          •



          •                                PL
              feeding on whatever they can find.
              As the mangrove leaves fall onto the mud,
              they are decomposed by bacteria. Prawns
              and crabs eat the partly decomposed leaves.
              Crab-eating macaques, a type of monkey,
              climb through the trees and catch crabs on the
              tree roots and mud.
                       M
         Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean
          •   During the winter in the Arctic Ocean, it is so cold
              that some of the sea water freezes.
          •   Seals hunt for fish in the water, but have to come to
SA

              the surface to breathe air.
          •   Polar bears patrol the ice, looking for seals to kill
              and eat. Polar bears are good swimmers, and can
              move from one ice floe to another.
          •   Arctic foxes also look for food on the ice.
          •   Enough light passes through the ice to allow tiny
              algae (single-celled plants) to grow on the underside
              of the ice floes.
          •   Tiny shrimp-like organisms eat the algae.
              Fish eat the shrimps.

        Rice paddy
         •       Not all ecosystems are natural. This area of rice
                 paddies in Malaysia is farmed by people.
         •       At some times of year, the paddy fields are flooded
                 with water. Algae grow in this shallow water, and
                 on the mud at the sides of the flooded areas.
         •       Fish swim into the flooded paddies from the
                 irrigation canals. Frogs and dragonflies breed

                 in the water.
         •       Because the water is shallow, it heats up quickly
                 during the day, and cools down quickly at night.
         •       Farmers often add fertiliser to the paddy fields,

                 Many birds feed in and around the paddy fields.

             Investigating a local ecosystem
             You are going to investigate an ecosystem near your school.
             For example, you could investigate:
             •    a garden area                  •    a group of trees
             •    part of the playing field      •    a pond.

             You will be working outside. It is important to stay in the same area as the rest
             of your class. Always stay with a partner.

          Continued
          It is important to remember that if you catch any animals, you must take great
          care of them. Do not take them away from their habitat. Release them exactly
          where you found them.
          Method
          1	 Look all around the area you are studying. What kind of ecosystem is it?
             Write a short description of it or draw a picture. For example: How big is it?
             What kind of plants grow there? Is there a lot of light, or is it shady? Is it




                                             E
             damp or dry?
          2	 Find different habitats in the ecosystem. For example, if you are studying
             a garden, habitats could include underneath stones, in the soil, on the
             soil surface, on leaves, in flowers, on tree trunks and in the air.

          3	 Look for organisms living in each habitat. Make a list of them. If you don’t
             know their names, take a picture or make a drawing. You might find some
             fungi, as well as plants and animals. If there are animals, what are they doing?
          4	 If possible, visit the ecosystem at different times of day – or even at night.
             How does it change?
          5	 Draw a diagram to show some of the interactions you have seen between the
             organisms, and between organisms and the non-living parts of the environment.
             For example, if you were looking at a garden:

        New species in an ecosystem
        In your studies of ecosystems, you have seen how all the different
        organisms interact with each other and their environment. In this topic,
        you will find out what happens if a new species suddenly arrives. How
        does the new species fit into the network of interactions? How does this
        affect the species already there?

        Introduced species in New Zealand
        New Zealand is a country in the Pacific Ocean. New Zealand




                                             E
        became separated from all the other areas of land in the world
        about 66 million years ago. Because of this separation, the
        species that developed in New Zealand were different from
        those elsewhere on Earth.




                                           PL
        Before humans arrived in New Zealand, there were no predatory
        mammals there. Many of the native species of birds nest on the
        ground. There were no predators to eat their eggs, so the eggs and
        young birds were safe. Even the adults of several species of native
        bird – such as the kiwi – cannot fly.
        Nobody knows exactly when humans first arrived in New Zealand,
        but it was probably about 700 years ago. Humans brought species of
        animals with them that did not belong in New Zealand. For example,
        rats stowed away on their boats. Rats now live in most of the country.
                       M
        The rats eat birds’ eggs and defenceless young birds.
        Since then, other species have been introduced to New Zealand.
        Farmers brought sheep, to farm for their wool and meat.
        Rabbits were brought on sailing ships, to use as food. But the
        rabbits escaped and began to eat grass in the sheep pastures.
        So people brought stoats from Europe to control the rabbits.
SA

        Now stoats have spread all over New Zealand. They are
        fierce hunters and breed rapidly. They can kill and eat birds
        much larger than themselves. Stoats have made several species
        of native bird extinct, including the laughing owl and the
        New Zealand thrush. Stoats eat almost 60% of kiwi chicks.
        People in New Zealand are now trying to eradicate (completely
        get rid of) stoats, but this is very difficult to do. The best that can
        be done is to control their numbers.
        Scientists think that 53 species of native bird in New Zealand
        have become extinct since humans arrived. The extinctions have
        been partly caused by people hunting and killing the birds, but
        mostly because of introduced invasive species.




                                                                                                                     135

             3	 Once all your ideas have been listed, work together with the rest of the class
                to make a shorter list. For example, perhaps you can explain some of the
                ideas more clearly if you use fewer words. Or perhaps two of the ideas are
                really the same idea, and can be combined.

         4 Ecosystems



         DDT
         DDT is an insecticide. This means that it
         kills insects.
         DDT was first produced in the 1940s. It was used
         to kill insects that transmit diseases. It was
         especially useful for killing mosquitoes that
         transmit malaria, and fleas that transmit a
         disease called typhus. DDT was also used to
         kill insects that eat crops.




                                             E
         No one thought that DDT could harm organisms
         other than insects. This old picture was taken in
         the 1940s. It shows a beach being sprayed with
         DDT to kill mosquitoes. The people on the beach
         are being sprayed, too.




                                           PL
         DDT is very good at killing insects. But gradually, people began to
         realise that it was also harming animals that no one wanted to kill.
         In 1962, an American author called Rachel Carson wrote a book called
         Silent Spring. She described how DDT was killing not only mosquitoes,
         but also birds.
         Her book made many people realise that some insecticides, including
         DDT, are very harmful to the environment. Scientists now understand
         how it causes harm to ecosystems.
                       M
         DDT in food chains
         We now know that DDT does not break down. It is a persistent
         chemical. It stays in the environment for many years. It is not
         broken down by decomposers.
SA

         When DDT is sprayed, some of it is carried
         up high into the air. It can be blown for
         very long distances, far away from where
         it was used.
         When DDT gets into an animal’s body, it
         stays there for the whole life of the organism –
         it never breaks down.
         DDT is very harmful to many kinds of animal.
         It is toxic (poisonous). For example, it makes
         the shells of birds’ eggs very thin and easy to
         break. The old photograph in Figure 4.4.2
         shows some eggs of a bird called an ibis. The
         eggs did not hatch, because the female ibis
         that laid them had DDT in her body.

          Think like a scientist

          Modelling DDT in a food chain

            You will need:
            •	 at least 25 people to do this activity – it’s even better with 30
            •	 at least 200 tokens, some blue, some yellow and some red
            •	 a stopwatch




                                             E
            •	 a cup or small bag for each person, to put tokens in
            •	 1 card with ’eagle’ written on it
            •	 several cards (about 8 in a class of 30) with ’small bird’ written on them
            •	 more cards (about 21 in a class of 30) with ’insect’ written on them.




                                           PL
            •	 one larger bag, big enough to hold all the cards
            •	 a method of marking out an area of ground outside, for example, traffic cones
               (you could borrow something from the sports department, or you might be able
               to use a marked-out part of a pitch used for sports)
            •	 a clipboard and paper so that someone (the teacher, or the eagle) can
               record results

          Method
                       M
          1	 Mark out an area big enough for people to run around. It could perhaps be
             25 m by 25 m, but the exact size does not matter.
          2	 Spread all of the coloured tokens randomly in the marked-off area.
          3	 Put all of the cards into the large bag. Each person puts a hand into the bag
             and takes one card.
SA

          4	 Everyone takes a small bag, and then stands on the edge of the marked-off area.
          5	 One person (it could be your teacher) starts a stopwatch and says: ‘Go!’ Each
             ‘insect’ goes and ‘feeds’ in the area. They do this by picking up tokens and
             putting them into their bags. Only one token can be picked up at once!
          6	 After 15 or 20 seconds, the timer shouts: ‘Stop!’ The insects stop feeding.
             Each ‘insect’ counts the tokens in their bag. They count how many tokens
             of each colour they have. The recorder writes down the results for each ‘insect’.
          7	 The timer starts the stopwatch again, and the ‘small birds’ go and feed on the
             ‘insects’. They do this by tapping an ‘insect’ on the shoulder. The captured
             insect transfers their tokens into the small bird’s bag. A ‘small bird’ can only
             eat one ‘insect’ at a time.




                                                                                                                     139

              area. Each small bird counts the tokens in their bag. The recorder writes down
              how many tokens of each colour each small bird has.

         Bioaccumulation and biomagnification
         Imagine that DDT has been sprayed onto some water. Tiny algae take
         up some of the DDT. Shrimps eat the algae, and fish eat the shrimps.
         Cormorants (fish-eating birds) eat the fish.
         All the DDT in all of algae that a shrimp eats over its lifetime
         accumulates, or builds up, in its body. The longer the organism lives, and
         the more DDT it takes in, the more DDT it gets in its body. This process
         is called bioaccumulation.
         All of the DDT in all of the shrimps that a fish eats accumulates in the
         fish’s body. Eventually, all the DDT in all of the fish that a cormorant
         eats in its lifetime accumulates in the cormorant’s body.

        This means that the concentration of DDT in an animal’s body
        increases as you go up the food chain. This is called biomagnification.
        The next diagram shows how the concentration of DDT in the bodies
        of species in a food chain increases along the chain. The concentration
        is measured in parts per million (ppm). This is the number of grams of
        DDT in one million grams of the organisms.

         5 Materials and their structure



         Atoms
         In stage 7 you learnt that atoms are so small that you cannot see them
         without using the most powerful microscopes yet invented. The word
         ‘atom’ comes from a Greek word that means ‘cannot be split’.
         All the atoms of a particular element are the same. Different elements
         have different atoms.


         What is an atom like?




                                             E
         Scientists have discovered that atoms are made up of                                             −
         even smaller particles, called sub-atomic particles. Atoms
         are made up of three kinds of particles protons, neutrons               proton
                                                                                                      +
         and electrons.                                                                                   +            nucleus
                                                                                neutron




                                           PL
         The particles are arranged in a similar way in all atoms.
         The protons and neutrons are grouped closely together
         in the centre of the atom. They form the nucleus of the
         atom. (Be careful not to confuse the nucleus of a cell
         with the nucleus of an atom.)
         The electrons move around the nucleus.
         The three different particles in an atom have different
         properties.
                                                                                electron

         •	   Protons and neutrons have much more mass than the electrons.
              In fact, electrons have almost no mass.
         •	   Protons and neutrons have the same mass.
         •	   Protons have a positive electrical charge.
         •	   Neutrons have no electrical charge.
SA

         •	   Electrons have a negative electrical charge.
         There is a lot of empty space between parts of the atom. This space
         really is completely empty – there is nothing in it at all.
         There is an attraction between the positive and negative charges. This
         electrostatic attraction between the positive charge on the protons and
         the negative charge on the electrons is what holds individual atoms
         together.

        the structure of the atom?



                                            PL
        Scientists from many different parts of the world have worked on a
        number of different ideas that have led to the model of the atom, that
        they use today.
        In the late 1890s a British scientist called J.J.Thompson discovered the
        electron. His model for the atom was that the electrons were scattered
        throughout the structure of the atom. It is sometimes called the ‘plum
        pudding model’ because the particles are arranged randomly throughout
        the model, like fruit in a cake or pudding.

         5 Materials and their structure


         One of Thompson’s students was originally from New Zealand.
         His name was Ernest Rutherford. Rutherford discovered the
         proton in 1909 and the nucleus in 1911.
         Rutherford’s most famous experiment was the gold foil experiment.
         In this experiment Rutherford fired fast moving particles, smaller
         than an atom, at very thin gold foil. Most of the particles passed
         straight through the foil. Only a few of the particles (about 1 in 8000)
         were deflected in various directions. (Deflected means that the direction
         of the particle was changed.)

         Rutherford’s gold foil experiment


         The results of this experiment led Rutherford to have the idea
         that the gold atoms must be mostly empty space, with their
         particles packed into a dense nucleus at the centre. This helped
         to move towards the model of the atom that scientists use
                                                                                                               −

         Rutherford’s model of the atom looked like this.                                                      + +++

         James Chadwick also worked with Rutherford and
         Thompson. In 1932, he proved that neutrons exist. This                                                     −

         scientists use today.
         When scientists make a discovery, they write about what they
         have done and what they think it means. Sometimes, if the                           Rutherford’s model of the atom
         work is very complicated, many different scientists may be
         involved. These different scientists can even be in different
         countries, still working together. This is called collaboration.
         Other scientists then look closely at the findings to see if they
         can repeat the experiments and that if the discovery is true.
         Some scientists actively look for mistakes in the work, or
         whether the conclusions about the results are wrong. This is
         called peer review.

        The stories of these scientists show how people from all over the world
        work together to develop their ideas. Each scientist builds on the ideas
        and the discoveries of others. Chadwick, Rutherford and Thompson
        won Nobel prizes for their work. Their experiments and ideas have
        helped us to understand the
        structure of the atom.
        There is still a lot we do not know about atoms. Scientists continue to
        work to improve our understanding of the structure of the atom. For
        example, scientists from all over the world are using the Large Hadron
        Collider in Switzerland to further understand the structure of matter.

        Pure elements
        If an element is pure; it means that every one of
        its atoms is exactly the same and made of just one
        type of atom. For example, pure gold is made of
        gold atoms. However, an alloy of gold may
        contain other metals such as copper or silver.
        When you buy gold it is usually marked to state
        if it is pure gold (24 carat) or an alloy such as
        18 carat or 9 carat. This is a measure of its




                                             E
        purity. The more gold it has, the higher its purity.
        18 carat gold has 18 parts out of 24 that are
        gold; the rest (6 parts out of the 24) is made up
        of other metals such as silver or copper. 18 carat
        gold has a purity of 75%. To calculate this:
                             18 × 100 = 75%

        When silver is sold, it is usually marked with the number of
        parts per thousand that are silver. So, silver marked 925 has
        925 atoms out of 1000 that are silver and 75 atoms of some
        other metal. You can see this mark in the photograph of the
        silver ring. Silver marked 900 is of lower purity than that
        marked 925.
        This silver ring has the mark 925.
        The ring contains 925 parts silver out of 1000 parts.
                                        925 × 100 = 92.5%

         5 Materials and their structure


         Diamonds are made from the element carbon. The carbon atoms are
         arranged in a particular way. If they are pure, diamonds contain no
         other elements. Pure diamonds are colourless and translucent (lets the
         light through).
         If diamonds have other elements mixed in with the carbon atoms, they
         can be different colours. For example, if a few carbon atoms per million
         are replaced with nitrogen, the diamond will be yellow. If some carbon
         atoms are replaced by atoms of the element boron, then the diamond
         will be blue. The rarest of all is a green diamond, formed when one atom
         per 1000 of carbon atoms is replaced by nitrogen, nickel or hydrogen.

        Seawater
        Seawater is made up of water and various
        salts such as sodium chloride. If you
        want to obtain sodium chloride from
        seawater you can evaporate off the water.
        In some countries this is done by letting
        seawater fill flat and shallow areas called
        beds, and allowing the water evaporate in
        the heat from the Sun.

        If you are trying to obtain pure sodium
        chloride this will be a problem because

         Pure products
         When a chemical reaction takes place and a product is formed from
         the reactants, it is often very important that the product is pure. For
         example when medicines are being made, the product needs to be free
         from any impurities that may upset the way the medicine works or that
         do the patient harm.
         When there is a simple reaction there is only one product.

        In other reactions there may be more than one product. When there
        is more than one product they are mixed up together. These products
        will need to be separated and purified to produce whichever pure
        product you want. The products may also be mixed up with some of
        the reactants if they have not all been used up in the reaction.

        What is weather?
        When you look out of the window, what is the weather like?
        What people mean by weather is the state of the atmosphere and its
        changes from minute to minute, hour to hour, day to day, or week to
        week. In some places, the weather is very similar each day but in others
        the weather changes frequently.
        When people talk about the weather they say things such as, ‘What is the
        weather like today?’, ‘How hot is it today?’ or ‘Will it rain tomorrow?’
        They are thinking in the short term.




                                             E
        People generally think about weather as the combination of temperature,
        humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, visibility and wind.
        Countries all over the world take careful measurements of the weather
        to help predict what will happen next, to see patterns in the weather and




                                           PL
        to provide information about the weather over time. For example, it is
        important to be prepared for snowstorms or heat waves as they can affect
        the transport systems, production of food, how much power people need
        to run their homes, and even what they want to buy in the shops.

           5	 Decide how your group will collect this information. What equipment will you need?
              You may need to do some research to decide this. You may need some laboratory
              equipment. A camera might also be useful as you could take photographs to record
              cloud cover.
                Remember that the readings should be taken at the same time each day.
                The temperature should be taken in the shade, not in full sun. The bulb of the
                thermometer should not be touching anything other than the air.

           2	 Why are the temperature readings always taken in the shade?
           3	 Write a report about the changes in the weather over the week. In this report you
              should present your observations in an appropriate way.
           4	 Plot a graph to show the changes in temperature over the week.
           5	 Compare your readings with someone else in your class. Are there any differences
              and, if so, can you give reasons for the differences? Is this comparison a fair
              comparison?
           6	 Compare your readings with those that are recorded nationally. You could use the
              internet to find these. Are yours different and, if so, explain why yours are different.
              Is this comparison a fair one?

         Weather or climate?
         What is the difference between weather and climate?
         When people talk about climate, they mean the weather of a place over a
         much longer time, usually more than 30 years. Weather can change in a
         few hours or even in minutes.
         Climate is the average weather in an area and takes several years
         to change. Climate information includes the statistics of weather
         information that tells us about the normal weather as well as the range




                                             E
         of extreme weather at that place.
         Weather is affected by factors such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness
         and precipitation.
         Climate is affected by two key factors: temperature and precipitation.

        Look back at the photograph in the Getting started section. When Yuka
        was alive, and for thousands of years afterwards, the Earth was much
        colder than it is now. The map shows the parts of the world that were
        covered by ice sheets 25 000 years ago.

         5 Materials and their structure



         Glacial and interglacial periods
         The very cold period when Yuka lived lasted until
         about 10 000 years ago. Because so much of the
         Earth was frozen, it is called a glacial period.
         ‘Glacial’ means ‘frozen’. Today, the Earth is in an
         interglacial period. ‘Inter’ means ‘between’. Over the
         last 450,000 years, the Earth’s climate has cycled or
         swung between glacial and interglacial periods.
         •	   In an interglacial period, there is permanent ice




                                              E
              close to the North and South Poles.
         •	   In a glacial period, the ice spreads much further
              south from the North Pole and further north                         When Yuka was alive, the Earth was in a glacial period.
              from the South Pole.                                                Much more of the Earth was frozen than now.


         Ice ages

                                            PL
         Looking even further back in time, scientists have found that this cycle
         of glacial periods and inter-glacial periods did not always happen. There
         were long periods of time when Earth was so warm that there was no
         permanent ice on its surface, not even at the North Pole or South Pole.
         In between these warm periods, there were cold periods, with glacials and
         interglacials. These cold periods are called ice ages.
                         M
         The graph in below shows when scientists think the ice ages happened
         on Earth. They think the second one, which began about 850 million
         years ago, was the coldest. Some scientists think that the whole Earth was
         covered with ice and snow then. The Earth was like a giant snowball.

        The photograph shows some boulders (big rocks) in
        California, USA. People have often wondered how
        rocks like this got into their strange positions. The
        best explanation is that they were carried there by




                                           PL
        ancient glaciers. Glaciers are rivers of ice that move
        slowly downhill (they are formed from snow that over
        many years becomes compressed into thick masses of
        ice). The glaciers carry rocks with them. If the glacier
        melts, the rocks are left behind. Sometimes, scientists
        can see scratches on the rock surfaces, where the
        moving ice dragged other rocks across them.
        Boulders like this were the first clue that glaciers
                                                                        These rocks are in Yosemite National Park, in California.

        used to be present in parts of the Earth that are
        much warmer now. Later, other evidence was found
        that supports this idea. For example, in places that
        are now quite warm, it is possible to find fossils of
        animals and plants that were adapted to live in very
        cold places.

        Questions
        5	 Use an atlas or the internet to identify and list
           glaciers nearest to where you live.
        6	 When rivers run through rock, they wear the
           rock away. This sometimes creates very deep                   A glacier in Iceland
           valleys, such as the Grand Canyon in Arizona.
           When glaciers moved millions of years ago,
           they left their mark on the landscape. Find out
           about and describe the effect that glaciers had
           on the land.

         5 Materials and their structure



         Pollen evidence for glacial and
         interglacial periods
         Scientists can use pollen to find out what kind of plants lived long ago.
         In New Zealand, a scientist extracted a core of soil from a peat bog.
         When plants die they normally decay. In some conditions, without
         oxygen and slightly acid, the decay is very slow and a peat bog may
         be formed. The different layers of peat represent different periods of
         history, the deeper the peat, the older it is. Scientists can take samples of




                                                 E
         the peat bog by using an instrument called an auger and remove a core
         of the peat bog. They must be careful to remove the core and keep it in
         the correct order so that they know which part is oldest.

         This scientist is using an auger to   A core sample from a peat bog showing different layers.
         extract a core sample.


         The deepest level of the soil in the core was formed 237 000 years
         ago. The scientist collected pollen from different parts of the core.
         He identified the plants from which the pollen came. Because he knew
         the type of climate that each kind of plant can live in, he was able to
         work out what the climate was like between years ago and now.

        The atmosphere
        The atmosphere is a layer of gas
        above the Earth’s surface. It is very
        different today from the atmosphere
                                                                                                               Earth’s

        Scientists think that the Earth was

        was molten for millions of years. Then, as the Earth cooled, a solid
        crust formed. There was a lot of volcanic activity, much more than
        there is now. The volcanoes produced gases, which formed the early
        atmosphere. Water vapour was produced by the volcanoes and, as the
        Earth cooled, this water vapour condensed into liquid water. The water




                                              PL
        fell as rain and formed the first lakes and oceans.
        About 4000 million years ago, scientists think that the atmosphere
        contained mainly carbon dioxide, little or no oxygen, small amounts
        of the gases methane and ammonia, and some water vapour. This early
        atmosphere on Earth was like the atmosphere on Venus is today. The
        temperature on Venus is very high – on the surface, it is which is hot
        enough to melt lead.

         5 Materials and their structure



         Changes to the atmosphere
         About 3500 million years ago, micro-organisms
         developed on Earth. They lived in the oceans and
         used the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to make
         food. They produced oxygen as a waste product of
         this process. As plants developed over millions of
         years, they began to grow on land. Plants use
         carbon dioxide to produce food (glucose, a sugar)
         by the process of photosynthesis.

             carbon dioxide + water  glucose + oxygen
         The levels of oxygen in the atmosphere continued
         to rise. Scientists know this because there was                  These rocks in Dallo, Ethiopia have bands of red iron

         By 200 million years ago there was very little carbon dioxide left in the
         atmosphere. Most of the carbon had been used to make the chemicals,
         which are part of all living things.
         When the organisms die and rot, the carbon in them is released back
         into the environment. It is recycled. Some organisms do not rot when
         they die and are turned into fossil fuels such as oil or coal. The carbon is
         locked up in the fossil fuels until they are burned them.
                         M
         Many organisms with shells evolved around 600 to 400 million years
         ago. The shells are made from calcium carbonate, CaCO3. When these
         shelled animals died and fell to the bottom of the oceans as sediment the
         many layers of shells pressing down on each other formed rocks, such as
         limestone. So carbon is also locked up in these rocks.

        is the carbon dioxide coming from? Humans caused this rise because
        they started to release the carbon that had been locked up in the Earth
        for millions of years. They burn fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, to


                             carbon + oxygen  carbon dioxide

        As humans developed industry and transport, they have burned more
        and more oil and coal. So there are greater emissions of carbon dioxide.

         5 Materials and their structure


         Humans also make the situation worse as they cut down forests of large
         established trees that use a lot of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. This
         deforestation is done for many reasons: to use the wood for building or
         to make things, to get to resources such as minerals which are mined, to
         produce crops for profit such as palm oil, to grow more food crops, or to
         provide pastures for animals such as cattle. Because there are fewer trees,
         less of the carbon dioxide is being used up, so the level in the atmosphere
         increases. Cattle eat the grass and produce carbon dioxide and gases such
         as methane in their intestines. This also changes the atmosphere.

         All these things lead to a change in the atmosphere and an increase in
         carbon dioxide levels.


         Atmospheric changes and climate
         There is evidence that the carbon dioxide and other gases, such as methane,
         act like a blanket around the Earth. This is an analogy. The ‘blanket’
         represents the gases that keep the Earth warm. Another analogy is that the
         gases are like putting the Earth in a greenhouse. A greenhouse lets in light
         and heat from the Sun, but heat energy is trapped inside.

        Think about how an analogy can help you to understand
        an idea?

        The layers of gases produce the greenhouse effect. This is a natural
        effect; without it, the Earth would be much colder. However, increasing
        the levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and
        water vapour, increases the greenhouse effect. So, as the levels of
        carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour increase, the amount of heat
        escaping decreases, and so the Earth’s climate becomes warmer.

        This is known as global warming.

        Reducing global warming


                                           PL
        You have seen that humans contribute to global warming by burning
        fossil fuels. One way to reduce this impact is to use renewable resources.
        A renewable resource is one that does not deplete (run out) or can be
        replenished within a human’s life time. Examples include wind, tidal and
        solar power.
        A non-renewable resource is a resource that cannot be replaced after it is
        used. Examples include coal, petroleum, and natural gas.
                       M
        Renewable resources
        When fossil fuels are burned to generate electricity, carbon dioxide
        is produced. This adds to the problem of global warming. The more
        electricity is produced, the more carbon dioxide adds to the problem. To
        reduce global warming people need to generate more of their electricity
SA

        from renewable energy resources. These energy resources will become
        more important as the supplies of fossil fuels run out.

         5 Materials and their structure


         Wind
         People have been using the power of the wind for hundreds of years.
         They used windmills to grind wheat into flour and to pump water.
         Now they use wind turbines to generate electricity. You need a lot of
         wind turbines to generate as much electricity as a power station so
         wind turbines are grouped together to form wind farms. No harmful
         waste product, such as carbon dioxide, is produced when electricity is
         generated in this way. The problem with wind-generated power is that
         electricity is only produced when the wind blows.

         Tides make water rise and fall twice every day.
         This happens as a result of the pull of the Moon’s
         gravity as the Earth spins. It is possible to use this
         movement to generate electricity. To do this you
         need to trap the water, in river estuaries, behind
         a barrier and then generate electricity by releasing
SA

         the water to flow through electricity generator
         turbines as the tide goes out. The problem is you
         can only generate electricity at certain times             A hydroelectric turbine at a tidal farm in Brest,

         Solar
         The energy from the Sun can be used to generate
         electricity. Photovoltaic cells can convert solar
         energy to electrical energy. This can only happen
         when the Sun is shining.

                                                                    These photovoltaic cells are part of a large solar energy farm

        Using other renewable resources
        Bioplastics
        The use of plastics has developed over the
        past hundred years. Plastics are very useful materials but they have
        one very big problem: they do not break down easily and cause many
        problems for wildlife when they are thrown away. The waste builds
        up on land and in the oceans. Humans produce a lot of plastic waste,
        especially from plastics that are only used once.
        Bioplastic is a biodegradable material that comes from renewable

         5 Materials and their structure



           Project: Global warming and climate change debate
           Background
           In June 2019, the average world temperature was . It was an increase of 1.1 oC
           above the average global temperature for the whole of the twentieth century.
           During this worldwide heat wave there were:
           •    wildfires in the Arctic with millions of hectares burning in Northern Russia
           •    heat waves and severe water shortages in India
           •    more than 5000 people in Japan taken to hospital for treatment due to the




                                             E
                heat wave
           •    a huge impact on the growth of crops.
           July 2019 was the hottest on record in Europe. People died of heat stroke.
           Overhead power cables expanded in the heat and failed. Crops were damaged
           so food production was affected.



                                           PL
           Scientists say it is the latest sign that the Earth is experiencing a huge increase in
           global warming. There is a wide sense amongst scientists that the rise in carbon
           dioxide emissions from human activities is altering the temperature. A climate
           researcher from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, said
           in a television interview:

               ‘This particular month has been very warm, but to me this is not the main point.
               All the months of 2019 have been warm in comparison to other years. And that
                       M
               trend is not likely to stop unless we do something about reducing the emission of
               greenhouse gases.’

           However, some people think that the change in temperatures is just part of the
           Earth’s normal cycle and there is no need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse

           gases as there is no proof it is these gases that cause climate change.
           Your task
           In your group (no more than four), draw up two lists of evidence and give your
           reasoning; one in support of the idea that humans are contributing to climate
           change and one that does not support that idea.
           Your teacher will select which point of view each group will represent. During
           the debate your group must stick to the point of view you have been given.

         6 Light



         Reﬂection
         When you think of reflection you probably think of using a mirror.
         Most of the mirrors you use are plane mirrors. ‘Plane’ means flat.
         To see what reflection looks like from a surface that is not plane,
         you can look at your own reflection from a spoon. The reflection
         is distorted.
         Remember that light travels in straight lines called rays. When drawing
         light rays, always use a ruler and put an arrowhead on the ray to show
         its direction.




                                             E
         A light ray arriving at a mirror is called an incident ray. An incident ray
         is the ray coming onto a surface.
         The incident ray makes an angle with the surface of the mirror. Measure
         this angle from a line perpendicular to the mirror and not from the mirror


         The diagram shows how to do this.

         itself. The line perpendicular to the mirror is called the normal. In physics

        These diagrams are called ray diagrams
        because they show what happens to the
        light rays during reflection.

        What we have drawn obeys the law of
        reflection. Which is that the angle of
        reflection is equal to the angle
        of incidence.

        In physics, a law is something that
        always applies.




                                             E
        We can use the law of reflection in
        everyday situations.

        In this picture, light from the Sun is reflected from the cyclist. This is the
        incident ray on the mirror. The reflected ray from the mirror goes to the
        driver’s eye.

        The ray diagram shows how this works.

          Activity 6.1.1
          Mirrors and reflections
          Work in pairs.
          Make a list of places where mirrors are used.
          In each of your examples, describe why a mirror is used.
          Reflections can also be seen from some surfaces that are
          not mirrors.




                                             E
          Make a list of some of these surfaces.
          What do these surfaces have in common?

        Refraction
        When you look through a glass of
        water or through a wet window, you
        cannot see clearly.
        Look carefully at the picture, which
        shows a glass of water on a table.
        The background, through the glass
        of water, appears distorted. Distorted
        means changed to be less clear.




                                             E
        The background appears distorted
        because of refraction.
        The material that light passes through
        is called a medium. Air, glass and water
        are each examples of a medium for
        light to pass through.


                                           PL            This glass of water is refracting the light passing through it.



        You will remember that light travels very fast. The speed of light in air
        is 300 000 kilometres per second. When light passes from air into water
        or glass, the light travels more slowly. The table shows how the speed of
        light changes according to the medium.

                   Medium                 Speed of light in kilometres per second

        The change of speed can cause the light to change direction.
SA

        Imagine you are on roller skates. You are moving at a constant speed
        on a hard surface. The roller skate on one foot goes onto grass. What
        happens? You will change direction because one roller skate is moving
        slower than the other.
        This is what happens when a ray of light passes from air into glass or
        water. One side of the ray of light slows down first, causing it to change
        direction.
        Refraction of light is defined as the change in direction of light on
        passing from one medium to another because of change in speed.

         Light passing from air into water or glass
         This ray diagram shows what happens when light passes                     incident ray
         from air into glass or water.                                                                 normal

         The light slows down when it passes from air into glass
         or water. This causes it to change direction.                                                        angle of incidence
                                                                                air
         The light passing from air into glass or water is bent                 glass or water                  angle of refraction
         towards the normal. That means the refracted ray is
         closer to the normal than it would be if the incident ray
         just carried on in a straight line.

         greater than the angle of refraction. Both of these angles            towards the normal.

         Light passing from water or glass into air
         The ray diagram in Figure 6.2.4 shows what happens
         when a ray of light passes from water or glass into air.
         The light speeds up when it passes from glass or water
         into air. This causes it to change direction.
         We say that the light passing from glass or water into air
         is bent away from the normal. That means the refracted
                                                                              air

         of these angles are measured from the normal.

         Refraction in everyday life
         Refraction can be a nuisance. It can stop you
         from seeing clearly through wet windows. Each
         individual drop of water on the window refracts
         light in a different direction, making it very difficult
         to see. This is why many vehicles have windscreen
         wipers. The windscreen wipers remove the water
         drops. It is then easier to see clearly as all the
         refraction from the glass is in the same direction.
                                                                         Drops of water on glass make it difficult to see because
                                                                         of refraction.

        Refraction can also be useful. Lenses are used in our eyes, in cameras
        and in glasses that people wear, to cause refraction of light. A lens is a
        curved piece of glass that is designed to refract light in a known way.

        This phone has a lens to refract light for a photograph.	    Different glasses refract light in different ways to help

           Repeat the demonstration in Effect 2: Broken pencil in water, but this time put water into
           the glass until it is only half full. Now, gently pour cooking oil on top of the water until the
           glass is about three-quarters full.
           View the glass and the pencil from the side again.

               about 5 cm away from the glass block and where it meets the glass block.
          5    Do the same for the ray that emerges from the glass block on the other side.
          6    Switch off the ray box and lift the glass block off the paper.
          7    Use the ruler to join up the light rays.
          8    Use the protractor to draw a normal at both surfaces.

         Newton’s discovery
         about light
         The name Newton is often associated with forces, but
         Isaac Newton made many other important discoveries.
         In the year 1666, Newton showed that white light
         could be split into different colours. The picture
         shows Newton using light from the Sun, coming
         through a hole. Newton is using a glass block in the




                                             E
         shape of a triangle to split the light into its colours.
         He is shining the colours onto a screen.
         The next picture shows what the colours look
         like when seen on a screen.


         The spectrum
                                           PL                                The colours that make up white light


         The range of colours that can be seen in white light is called a spectrum.
         In the spectrum, the colours are not separate but they merge from one
         to another.
         Some people think Newton originally saw five or six colours, but most
         people now agree that there are seven. In the order that they appear in
         the spectrum, these seven colours are:
                       M
                   red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
         You can remember the order of the colours using a made-up person’s
         name: ‘ROY G. BIV’.

         Dispersion
SA

         Dispersion means splitting light into different colours.
         Dispersion happens because light is refracted. Each of
         the different colours of light that make up white light
         is refracted through a slightly different angle. This can
         be shown by using a triangular prism. ‘Triangular’
         means in the shape of a triangle. A prism is a solid
         shape such as the one that Newton used.
         When a ray of white light passes through the prism,
         the ray is refracted. Violet light is refracted through
         the largest angle and red light is refracted through
         the smallest angle. You can see this in the picture.                Dispersion of white light, using a triangular prism

        Rainbows
        A rainbow is formed when drops of water in the air
        cause dispersion of light. The light is also reflected
        from inside the drops of water. That means that, for
        you to see a rainbow:
        •    the Sun must be shining, to provide bright light
        •    there must be rain or small drops of water
             in the air, to cause dispersion of light




                                              E
        •    the Sun must be behind you, because the water
             drops reflect the light inside them.
        The drops of water from the hosepipe in Figure 6.3.4 are making
        a rainbow. The Sun is shining and the Sun is behind the camera.

        Primary colours
        Topic 3.3 explained that there are seven colours in white light. These are
        the colours that can be seen in the rainbow.
        However, there are three colours of light from which all other colours
        of light can be made. These are called the primary colours. The primary
        colours cannot be made by mixing any other colours of light.
        The primary colours of light are:
        •	   red                      •	   green                     •	     blue.




                                              E
        The primary colours of light are different from the primary colours in
        paints. The colours in light mix differently from the colours in paint.

        Adding colours of light



        •	 red + green = yellow
        •	 red + blue = magenta
        •	 blue + green = cyan
        •	 red + green + blue = white.
                                            PL
        The diagram shows what happens when three beams of light, each
        of a different primary colour, overlap.
        You can see the effect of adding the primary colours:                                            magenta

         6 Light


         When you look at a television or phone screen, you see far more colours
         than just red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow and white. Most screens
         can display 256 different colours. Changing the brightness of the primary
         colours makes all these different colours. For example, orange is made by
         adding red and green, but with the red brighter than the green. Research
         has shown that 256 is the maximum number of colours that most people
         can see.

         Subtracting colours of light
         You have probably used a filter in your chemistry lessons. Filters




                                                E
         are used to remove something from a mixture.
         You can also use coloured filters to remove colours from light.
         If a transparent piece of coloured glass or plastic is placed in
         front of a white light, then only light of that colour will be




                                              PL
         transmitted (get through). All the other colours will be absorbed.
         A common example of coloured filters is in traffic lights.
         The traffic lights use three identical white lamps. In front of each
         lamp is a coloured filter for red, yellow or green.
         Take the red filter as the example to see how this works.
         White light, from the lamp, is made from the seven colours of
         light: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
                        M
         When these seven colours arrive at the red filter, only red is
         transmitted. The other six are absorbed. This is shown in                               These traffic lights use coloured filters.
         the diagram.
SA


         Figure 6.4.3: A coloured filter works by absorbing the colours of light that are different from
         the colour of the filter.


         This is an example of subtraction of light. White light has had six
         colours subtracted to leave only red.
         In the traffic lights, the yellow and green filters work in exactly the same
         way. Each of them absorbs six colours and only transmits one colour.

        The blue stage light in the picture has a white lamp and a blue filter. If you
        look carefully, you can see where the white lamp is inside the black case.
        The colours of the filters in stage lights can be changed to produce
        different colours.
        Photographers sometimes use coloured filters on a camera to get
        different effects.

        This stage light is using a white lamp and a blue filter.	       What colour was the filter used in taking this photograph?


        As with numbers, it is possible to subtract colours of light until the end
        result is zero.
        For example, if white light shines on a green filter, only green light will
SA

        get through. The other colours of the white light are absorbed.
        If this green light then shines on a red filter then no light will get
        through. Green is one of the colours that a red filter absorbs.

         6 Light



         Seeing colours
         When you look at a non-luminous object, you see the light that is
         reflected from the object. ‘Non-luminous’ means the object does not
         emit its own light.
         Look at the flower in the picture.
         The flower is seen in white light. The flower looks yellow because it
         reflects only yellow light. The flower absorbs the other six colours in
         white light. This is shown in the diagram.

        The red cube appears black when seen in green light.
        This is because red objects only reflect red light.

           Making colours on the screen
           Many computer applications, such as those for word-processing
           and slide-making, have colour options. In the ‘more colours’
           options of these there are RGB tools to customise colours.
           The letters RGB stand for ‘red’, ‘green’ and ‘blue’, the primary
           colours of light. You can adjust these to make whatever colour
           you want. For example, bright red has:




                                             E
           •    R at maximum
           •    G at zero
           •    B at zero.
           Bright yellow has:
           •
           •
           •



           •
                R at maximum
                G at maximum
                B at zero.
           Try making:
           •    magenta
                cyan

           •    white
           •    black.

          Method
          1	 Write the names of some colours on a piece of coloured paper.
             Use different coloured pens to write each word. The colours do not
             have to match correctly.
                 For example, on yellow paper, write:
                 •	 ‘blue’ with blue pen
                 •	 ‘red’ with green pen




                                             E
                 •	 ‘green’ with blue pen.
          2	 Use the flashlight and a red filter to illuminate the paper.
          3	 Ask someone from a different group to identify:
                 •	 the colour of the paper



                                           PL
                 •	 the words that are written in the correct colours
                 •	 the colours of pen used to write the other words.
          4	 Vary the words, the colours of the pens, the colours of the paper and the
             colours of the filters, and repeat steps 1–3.

               colours
             	 I can understand why coloured objects appear coloured when seen in white light
             	 I can predict the colours that objects will appear to be, when seen in light of different colours.

        The Milky Way
        If you look at the sky on a clear night, far away from any lights, you can
        see a milky band across the sky. This milky band is part of the galaxy
        where we live, called the Milky Way. The photograph shows what this
        looks like through a camera set for very low light conditions.

        This is part of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.


        The word ‘galaxy’ comes from a Greek word for ‘milky’.
                         M
        Shapes of galaxies
        The reason why our own galaxy looks like a
        band across the sky is because of the shape
        of the galaxy. The Milky Way is a spiral
SA

        galaxy. If you were to look at the Milky Way
        from far away, it would appear as a spiral.
        Because we live in a spiral galaxy, we can
        only see one ‘arm’ of the spiral, which is
        that band across the sky. In fact, most of
        the stars we see at night are in our own
        galaxy. There are an estimated 250 000 000
        stars in the Milky Way including our Sun.               This is what the Milky Way would look like from far away.

        There are other galaxies in the universe besides our own. The word
        ‘universe’ is used to describe all of space and everything in it.
        These other galaxies have different shapes, and they are classified
        according to shape. They are called elliptical galaxies or irregular galaxies.

         The closest known galaxy to the Milky Way is called the Canis Major
         Dwarf Galaxy. It is elliptical in shape and a distance of away from us.


         What are galaxies made of?


                                                PL
         Galaxies are made from stellar dust, gas, stars and solar systems held
         together by gravity. Stellar dust is the dust that is found in space. The
         Earth is travelling through a cloud of stellar dust that is estimated to
         contain an average of one dust particle in every million cubic metres
         of space!
         The gravity holding a galaxy together is very strong because galaxies
         are very large and have very large mass. Even if you could travel at the
         speed of light (300 000 kilometres per second), it would take you more
                         M
         than 100 000 years to cross from one side of the Milky Way to the other!
         Scientists estimate the mass of the Milky Way to be 1 500 000 000 000 times
         the mass of the Sun.


         How many galaxies are there?
SA

         Scientists have counted the galaxies in one part of space. The scientists
         then multiplied this number up to estimate the number of galaxies in the
         universe. The answer they got was 100 000 000 000 galaxies!
         Estimates such as this may not be accurate. There could actually be
         more or fewer galaxies in the part of space that the scientists counted
         compared with the rest of the universe. Also, the scientists may not
         know the total volume of the universe accurately.

                                           PL
          In this investigation, you will use an analogy for estimating the number of

SA

            • access to laboratory equipment for measuring masses and volumes

          Scientists cannot count the number of stars in a galaxy because there are too
          many. However, scientists can estimate the number of stars in a galaxy.
          You are going to estimate the number of grains of sand in your container.
          There are too many to count them all, so this activity is an analogy for how

          Method
          1	 Put a small quantity of sand from the large container onto the white paper and
             separate the grains. You should only put out the quantity you can count easily.

           5	 This number is an estimate of the total number of grains in the large container.
                a	 Explain the advantage of this method compared to counting all the grains
                   in the large container.
                b	 Give reasons why the estimate may not be accurate.
SA

                c	 Suggest some ways that the estimate could be made more accurate.
           6	 Suggest how working as a whole class is an analogy for how scientists studying
              the Milky Way work.
           7	 Knowing roughly how long it took you to count your grains in step 2, estimate
              how long it would take you to count all the grains in the large container.
           8	 Suggest how you could estimate the number of grains of sand on a beach.

           Self-assessment
           Decide how confident you are about each of these:
           •	 understanding how this method of estimating works
           •	 whether you could apply this method to estimating some other large quantity.

        Asteroids
        Asteroids are objects made from rock that orbits the Sun.
        Asteroids range in size up to 975 km across. The smallest asteroid that
        has been studied is 2 m across.
        Most asteroids are not regular shapes, just as rocks on Earth are not
        regular shapes.
        Scientists describe the shape of most asteroids as being similar to the
        shape of potatoes.




                                             E
        Most of the asteroids in the Solar System orbit the Sun between the
        orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This part of the Solar System is called the
        asteroid belt.
        There are millions of asteroids. Some that have been studied have been
        given names.

        The largest asteroid is called Ceres and was discovered in the year 1801.
        When Ceres was discovered, scientists thought it was a new planet. As
        Ceres looked much smaller than a planet, the term asteroid was introduced.
        This photograph of Ceres, was taken by a spacecraft in 2015.
        Ceres looks like a small planet. It is round, with a diameter of 975 km,
        and covered with craters.
        Ceres also has a core, a mantle and a crust like some planets.
                       M
        Scientists think that Ceres would have become a planet if it had
        continued to grow during the formation of the Solar System.
        The next photograph shows asteroid Itokawa, which is one of the
        smallest asteroids to be visited by a spacecraft.
        Asteroid Itokawa is about 530 m long and about 250 m wide. In the
        year 2005, a spacecraft collected samples from the surface of Itokawa.

                                                                                              Ceres is an unusual asteroid and
        It was the smallest asteroid to be visited at that time.                              also the largest.
        Study of the samples has given scientists more evidence about how the
        Solar System formed.
        Itokawa appears to be made from lumps of rock. These lumps of rock
        appear to have come from other small planets or moons which have
        been broken by impacts. The force of gravity holding the lumps of rock
        together is weak because the asteroid is a relatively small object. When
        an asteroid such as Itokawa passes a large object such as a planet, tidal
        forces can change the shape of the asteroid.
        Some asteroids are made from a single piece of rock. Scientists know
        this because these asteroids are small and spin quickly. The force of
        gravity in these asteroids would be too weak to hold separate pieces                  Itokawa is an asteroid that has

         Asteroids and Earth
         Scientists think that a large asteroid impacts
         the Earth on average every 130 000 years.
         Smaller asteroids impact with Earth
         very frequently.
         The map in Figure 6.6.3 shows where
         asteroids impacted Earth between the
         years 1994–2013. These smaller asteroids

          Project: Investigating refraction
          Refraction is all around you every day. Refraction is generally what allows you see
          transparent objects.
          Dissolve some white sugar or salt in water. Make sure it is all dissolved so you have
          a transparent solution.
          Now take a transparent container holding some water. Look at the water from the
          side and slowly pour your sugar or salt solution into the water.
          Describe what you see.

          •	 sugar and salt to dissolve in water.
          Safety
          Remember to keep liquids away from the power supply and the ray box.

          diagrams in Topic 6.2.
SA

          Investigate how each substance refracts light.
          When you dissolve sugar or salt in water, does it change how the light is refracted?
          Does the concentration of the sugar or salt affect the refraction?
          Which substance refracts the light through the largest angle?
          Which substance refracts the light through the smallest angle?
          Record all your results and present them in the most effective way.
          Can you now explain what you see when you pour the sugar or salt solution into water?

         7 Diet and growth


         Protein, carbohydrate and fat are nutrients. Nutrients are substances
         found in food, that you need to stay healthy. These three photographs
         some of the kinds of food that you can eat to get these nutrients.

                                            PL
         You do not eat all the time, but you need energy all the time. You get
         almost all of your energy from the carbohydrates and fats that you eat.
         You can also get energy from protein if you run out of carbohydrates
         and fats.
         You store a little bit of carbohydrate, and quite a lot
         of fat, in your body. These energy stores provide you
                       M
         with energy whenever you need it.
         You store a small amount of carbohydrate in your
         cells, especially in the liver and muscles. These are
         short-term energy stores.
         For long-term stores, your body stores fat in special
SA

         cells under-neath the skin and around some of the
         body organs.
         Fat stores in the body also provide heat insulation.
         Animals that live in cold places, like this seal, have
         a lot of fat stores underneath their skin, to help to
         stop them losing heat from their body.

                                           PL
          You are going to try to find out which types of food contain starch.
          You can use iodine solution to find out if a food contains starch.
          Iodine solution is orange-brown. When it mixes with starch, it becomes very dark blue-black.

            You will need:
                       M
            •	 at least six different kinds of food
            •	 some paper plates or other place to put the pieces of food, keeping them separate
            •	 a white tile
            •	 a bottle of iodine solution, with a dropper
SA

          Method
          1	 Collect six different kinds of food. Try to include some foods that come from plants,
             and some that come from animals. Make sure you keep them completely separate
             from one another.
          2	 Draw a results table like this:

        Vitamins
        Vitamins are nutrients that are needed in only small amounts, but if you
        don’t eat them you can get ill.
        There are lots of different kinds of vitamin. Each kind is given a letter.

         Vitamin A
         Vitamin A is needed to help your eyes to work well, so
         that your vision is good. It is particularly important for
         helping us to see when it is quite dark. People who don’t




                                             E
         have enough vitamin A in their diet may not be able to
         see anything at night. It also helps your white blood cells
         to fight pathogens.
         You get vitamin A by eating green vegetables, carrots and
         squash (such as pumpkin), fruit, foods made from milk


         Vitamin C
                                           PL
         (such as cheese) and some kinds of fish.


         Vitamin C helps the skin to stay strong and to heal quickly
         if it is damaged. It keeps blood vessels and bones healthy.
         People who don’t eat enough vitamin C can get an illness
         called scurvy. A person with scurvy feels weak and may
         have swollen, bleeding gums.
         You get vitamin C by eating fresh fruit and vegetables.
                       M
         Citrus fruits are particularly rich in vitamin C. Potatoes and
         colourful berries are also good sources of vitamin C.
         In the past, before anyone knew about vitamin C, sailors
         on long sea voyages often got scurvy. This was because
         they had no fresh fruit or vegetables to eat.
SA

         Vitamin D
         Vitamin D is needed for strong bones and teeth. It helps
         the body to absorb calcium from the food that you eat.
         There are not many kinds of food that contain vitamin D.
         Oily fish is probably the best source. But for most people,
         most vitamin D does not come from the food that you
         eat. Instead, vitamin D is made in the skin when sunlight
         falls onto it.
         People who never go outdoors, or who never get any
         sun on their skin, may not get enough vitamin D. This is
         most likely to happen if you live in a country far from the
         equator, or where there is not much sunshine.
         In children, lack of vitamin D can stop their bones growing
         normally. This illness is called rickets.

           Activity 7.1.1
           Vitamins poster
           Work in a group of three for this activity.
           You will need a big piece of paper, and some coloured pens or pencils.
           Divide the sheet of paper into three equal areas. Label the areas Vitamin A,
           Vitamin C and Vitamin D.
           Use the information in this book, the internet and/or the library to find out which
           foods contain a lot of each vitamin.




                                             E
           Draw pictures of the foods in each space. If you like, you could also cut out
           some pictures of foods from packaging or magazines, and stick the pictures
           onto your poster.



         Minerals
                                           PL
         There are several different kinds of mineral that you need to eat.
         Two of the most important ones are calcium and iron.

         Calcium
         Bones and teeth contain calcium, so you need to eat plenty
         of calcium to make them strong. Foods made from milk
                       M
         are excellent sources of calcium. Seeds and some types of
         nut (for example, almonds) also contain
         a lot of calcium.



         Iron
SA

         Iron is needed to make haemoglobin. If you don’t eat
         enough iron, you don’t make enough haemoglobin, so
         not enough oxygen is transported around the body. This
         causes an illness called anaemia, which makes a person feel
         very tired. Good sources of iron include meat (especially
         red meat), dark green vegetables, many kinds of fish and
         shellfish and some nuts and seeds.

             vitamin D, calcium and iron instead of
             protein, carbohydrate and fats.
             Then complete your table.

        5    These bell peppers are stuffed with beef
             mince and vegetables, and topped with
             cheese. They contain a lot of iron
             and calcium.




        Water                              PL
             What other nutrients do you think this
             meal contains? Explain your answer.




        There is one more nutrient to add to the list of what you need to take
        into your body each day. This is water.
        Water is needed for many different purposes in the body. Cells and
                       M
        blood contain a lot of water. Almost 90% of a person’s body weight
        is made up of water. Water in cells allows all the different chemicals
        inside them to dissolve, so that they can react together. These reactions
        keep us alive. Water in blood allows it to flow easily, transporting
        substances all over the body.

        Diet
        Your diet is the food that you eat each day. Your diet should provide you
        with some of all the different kinds of nutrients. It should also give you
        the right amount of energy.
        A diet that provides all the different kinds of nutrients, and the right
        amount of energy, is called a balanced diet.

        How much energy?




                                             E
        Each day, the energy in the food you eat should be approximately equal
        to the energy that you use up. Most of your energy comes from the
        carbohydrates and fat that you eat.
        Different people use different amounts of energy. For example:

             If you do a lot of sport, or walk or run a lot each day, you use

             If you don’t move around much, you use less energy.
             Some people’s genes mean that their body uses up energy more
             quickly than other people doing the same thing.
             If you are growing fast, you need extra energy to help your cells
             to divide.
             Tall people use more energy to move their body around than
             small people.

         Different diets

                                           PL
         Everyone is different. Different people need different diets. Everyone
         needs plenty of minerals and vitamins, but people vary in how much
         protein and carbohydrate they need. Here are some examples.

                                                      use a lot of energy, then they need to eat

        Fibre
        As well as the six nutrients you need in your diet, you
        also need to eat plenty of fibre.
        Fibre is not actually a nutrient. This is because, when
        you eat it, you cannot digest it. So it does not go into
        the blood or to your cells. Instead, it just travels all
        the way through the digestive system. It leaves the
        body as faeces.




                                             E
        You might think this means that it is no use to you, but
        in fact fibre is very important to keep the digestive
        system healthy. It helps to prevent constipation, when
        the digestive system slows down and faeces collect
        inside it, instead of being passed out.




                                           PL
        Fibre is mostly cellulose. Remember that plant cell walls are made of
        cellulose, so foods made from plants are a good source of fibre. Cereal
        grains, seeds and fresh fruit and vegetables are all excellent sources of
        fibre. And the good thing about this is that these foods usually contain
        lots of different minerals and vitamins, too.

             d     I get energy from carbohydrate and (calcium/fat).

        Food groups
        It can be quite difficult to think about which nutrients are in each kind
        of food that you eat. To make it easier, it sometimes helps to think about
        food groups.

         Not too much
SA

         Although you should try to include every different kind of nutrient in
         your diet, there are some things that you should not eat too much of.
         •	   Too much sugar (a kind of carbohydrate) can make your teeth decay.
              It also increases the risk of developing an illness called diabetes.
         •	   Too much fat, oil or carbohydrate can make you put on weight.
              This can put a strain on your joints, heart and other body organs.
         •	   Eating too many fats that come from animals can increase the risk
              of developing heart disease.

         7 Diet and growth



         Growth
         Every person on Earth began their life as a single cell. This cell divided
         to produce two cells. Each of these cells got bigger, then divided again.




                    A single cell               Each cell                   The cells                      Each cell
                    divides into two.           grows.                      divide again.                  grows.




                                                  E
         To begin with, the cells are all the same. They produce a little ball of
         cells called an embryo, and eventually a baby.
         This all happens inside the mother’s body. By the time the baby is born,
         it is a miniature human being. It continues to grow until it is about
         18–20 years old.




                                                PL
         Cells contain a lot of protein. Energy is needed to make cells divide.
         A pregnant woman and a growing child need plenty of protein in their
         diet, as well as enough energy to help cells to divide.

         Development
         The change from a single cell to an adult human involves more than just
         growth. As the tiny embryo grows into a baby, all its different tissues
         and organs are formed. As the baby grows into a child, its leg muscles
                        M
         and bones become stronger, so that it can walk and then run. Its brain
         develops, as it learns to talk and to play with toys.
         These changes are called development.
         Each person is an individual, and everyone grows and develops at
         different rates, and in slightly different ways. But everyone goes through
SA

         the same stages in development. These are shown in the chart in. Notice
         that each stage blends gradually into the next one – there are no sharp
         divisions between them.

        Exercise and health
        Topic 7.2 described some of the ways in which your diet can affect your
        health. There are other ways in which the decisions you make about
        your lifestyles can affect how healthy you are.
        Taking regular exercise is a really good thing to do. This helps to use
        some of energy in the food you eat each day, stopping you from storing
        too much as fat. It also makes the heart and muscles work hard, so that
        they become strong. Exercise can also make people feel more cheerful
        and positive about life.

        Smoking
        Smoking cigarettes damages the smoker’s health. It also damages the
        health of people around them, who accidentally breathe in cigarette smoke.


        Nicotine
                                           PL
        Tobacco contains many different harmful substances.


        Tobacco smoke contains nicotine. Nicotine can help someone to stay alert. Nicotine is addictive.
        This means that it is difficult to manage without it, once you are used to smoking. This is why
        smokers find it so difficult to stop smoking.
        Nicotine damages the blood vessels in a smoker’s body. It makes them get narrower, so it is harder
        for blood to get through them. Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to develop heart disease.

        Particulates
        Tobacco smoke contains tiny particles of carbon and other materials, called particulates.
        They get trapped inside the smoker’s lungs. This makes the walls of the alveoli break down.
        Instead of having millions of tiny alveoli in the lungs, the smoker has a lot of big spaces.
        This is makes it difficult for them to get enough oxygen into their blood.

         Your skeleton is inside your body. It is made
         of bones. You do not need to remember the
         names of all of these bones, but you may know
         some of them already.

         Bones are hard and strong. They contain a lot                radius
         of calcium. If you do not have enough calcium               carpals
         in your diet, your bones may not grow properly.

         Bones cannot bend. Movement in the skeleton
         can only take place where two bones meet one
         another. These places are called joints.
         Some joints work like the hinges on a door.
         They let the bones move back and forth in

         Some joints let the bones move in a complete circle. At these joints, one
         of the bones has an end shaped like a ball. The other bone has a cup, or
         socket, that the ball fits into. These are called ball-and-socket joints.

         Muscles
         Bones and joints cannot move themselves. You use muscles to move
         bones at joints.
         Muscles are made of specialised cells. These cells are able to make
         themselves shorter. This is called contraction.
         Muscles use energy to contract. Like all cells, they get this energy from
         nutrients, especially glucose. The energy is released from glucose by
         respiration. The more you ask your muscles to contract, the more energy
         they use, and therefore the more glucose they use.




                                             E
         Muscles can produce a strong pulling force when they

         contract. Many of your muscles are attached to bones,
         by tough cords called tendons. When the muscle
         contracts, it pulls on the tendon, which pulls on the
         bone. This makes the bone move at a joint.

        Straightening the elbow joint
        Now think about how you straighten your arm at the elbow joint.
        It’s important to remember that muscles can only pull. They
        cannot push. Muscles can generate a force by getting shorter, or

        When a muscle is not contracting, it relaxes. This is all that
        muscles can do – they can either contract or relax.

         Antagonistic muscles
         You can see that the biceps muscle and the triceps muscle work as a team.
         •     To bend the arm, the biceps contracts and the triceps relaxes.
         •     To straighten the arm, the triceps contracts and the biceps relaxes.
         Two muscles that work together like this are called antagonistic muscles.
         When one of them contracts, it moves the bones at a joint in one
         direction. When the other muscle contracts, it moves the bones in the
         other direction.

          Continued
          Method
          1	 Read through the method. Then construct a results chart to fill in your results.
          2	 Put some masses on the hanger. Start with just one or two masses. (Make sure you
             record these masses in your results table.)
          3	 Attach the newton meter to hook 1. Pull gently and steadily vertically upwards until
             the ‘radius’ makes a right angle with the ‘humerus’. Record the force reading on the
             newton meter as you keep the radius in this position.

          4	 Now attach the newton meter to hook 2, and repeat.
          5	 Repeat again, with the newton meter attached to hook 3 and then hook 4.
          6	 Put some more masses on the hanger. Repeat steps 4 to 6.
          Questions



                                           PL
          1	 What does the newton meter represent in this model?
          2	 What happened to the force needed to keep the radius horizontal, as you moved the
             newton meter further away from the elbow joint?
          3	 Use what you have learnt about turning forces (moments) in your physics lessons to
             explain your answer to question 2.
          4	 What happened to the force needed to move the radius, when you added extra
             masses to the hanger?
                         M
          5	 Use what you have learnt about turning forces (moments) in your physics lessons to
             explain your answer to question 4.
          6	 Which position – 1, 2, 3 or 4 – matches the position where the real biceps is attached
             to the real radius?
SA

          7	 Muscles can produce very strong forces when they contract. But they cannot make
             themselves very much shorter. Suggest why the real biceps is attached in this position.


          Summary checklist
             	   I can name the bones in the arm.
             	   I can identify some hinge joints and ball-and-socket joints in the body.
             	   I can describe how muscles produce a force when they contract.
             	   I can explain how the biceps and triceps work as antagonistic muscles to move the arm
                 at the elbow.

          Project: A diet for Mars explorers
          In this project, you will evaluate issues that require scientific understanding.
          Your task
          You are going to work with everyone else in your class to produce a display about
          feeding astronauts as they travel to Mars and back.
          The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, is hoping to send people
          to Mars by the 2030s. They have many problems to solve if they are going to achieve this.
          One problem is how to feed the astronauts so that they stay healthy and strong during




                                             E
          the long trip. It would take up to three years to go to Mars and back.
          Here are some problems and suggestions that are being discussed by scientists
          and others.
          •    NASA could send a spaceship loaded with five years’-worth of food to arrive on

               Mars before the astronauts arrive. Would that work better than the astronauts
               taking all their food with them?
               It would take up less space if the food could just be pills, instead of ‘real’ food.
               Would that work?
               The bones and muscles of astronauts get smaller and weaker when they are in space
               for a long time. Are there any kinds of food that might help to reduce this problem?
               To get fresh vitamins, astronauts need to eat fresh plant-based
               foods. Could they grow plants on their spaceship? Could they
                       M
               grow plants on Mars?
          Work in a group of four or five. Choose one or two of these
          problems – it would be good if different groups choose different
          ones. Use the internet to find other people’s ideas for solving
          them. You might also have your own ideas.

          Work with the other groups in your class to produce a
          display about how to feed the Martian astronauts.

        Burning
        When something burns, a chemical reaction takes place. Burning
        is a chemical reaction in which a substance combines with oxygen.

        Fuels have a store of chemical energy. Charcoal, wood, coal,
        natural gas and oil are examples of fuels.

        light and sound energy. The thermal, light and sound energy                       Burning requires oxygen, fuel and
        dissipate (spread out) into the surroundings.                                     heat (thermal energy)

        Look back at the equation in Getting started. You can see that, during
        the reaction, the atoms of carbon and oxygen join together in new ways.
        When this happens, chemical energy is changed to thermal energy and
        the temperature rises.
        A chemical reaction in which thermal energy is given out is called an
        exothermic reaction.

        Questions
        1	 What is needed for combustion to take place?
        2	 What is an exothermic reaction?
        3	 How can you tell that burning is an exothermic reaction?

         8 Chemical reactions



         Burning other substances
         Hydrogen can be used as a fuel in a model rocket. The combustion
         of hydrogen is an exothermic reaction. The hydrogen and the oxygen
         combine to form water.

         When the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen rearrange themselves and
         combine together, energy is given out. This chemical energy is changed

         Burning hydrogen can propel a plastic bottle like a rocket.


         In this experiment, a large plastic soda bottle filled with hydrogen and
         air is attached to a string across the room. The stopper in the bottle has
SA

         wires that allow a spark to be generated. The hot spark provides the
         energy to start the reaction. The hydrogen and oxygen react together.
         The reaction gives out a lot of energy and the stopper is pushed out.
         This energy makes the bottle shoot (move very quickly) along the string.

        The reactions of other substances burning in air are also exothermic
        reactions. An example is burning magnesium, which produces magnesium
        oxide. Energy is given out as heat and light as the magnesium and oxygen
        atoms rearrange themselves.

        When a substance burns, it combines with oxygen and a new substance
        called an oxide is formed. Any reaction in which a substance combines
        with oxygen is an oxidation reaction.

         8 Chemical reactions



         Endothermic reactions
         Some chemical reactions absorb thermal energy from their surroundings
         and change it to chemical energy stored in the chemical bonds. These are
         called endothermic reactions. When an endothermic reaction takes place,
         the temperature at the end of the reaction is lower than that at the start
         of the reaction.

         Looking at endothermic reactions
         This is the word equation for the reaction between sodium hydrogen
         carbonate and citric acid:
                 sodium hydrogen carbonate + citric acid               sodium citrate + water + carbon dioxide
         During this reaction, thermal energy is absorbed from the surroundings
         and stored in the form of chemical bonds. So, if this reaction was carried
         out in a test tube, the surroundings will have a lower temperature and
         the test tube will feel cooler.

        If you eat sherbet sweets, this reaction takes place in your mouth. The
        sherbet is a mixture of dry citric acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate.
        When you eat the sweets, these substances dissolve in your saliva,
        and react together. This gives a cool ‘fizzy’ feeling in your mouth (the
        surroundings), which is refreshing.

        Ice melting is another endothermic process. Thermal energy
        is absorbed from the surroundings as the solid ice changes
        to liquid water. Think about what happens to the particles                        energy
        when water changes state. The particles in the ice are lined                      taken in
        up in rows and can only vibrate about fixed positions – they
        cannot move around inside the ice. The forces between the
        particles are strong.
        As the particles absorb thermal energy from the surroundings, they
        vibrate more and more. The ice begins to melt. When the particles have
        enough energy, they can move and overcome the forces holding them in
        place. The particles can now slide past one another. The water is now in
        a liquid state.

         8 Chemical reactions



         Using exothermic reactions
         Some exothermic reactions are used to produce
         self-heating cans of food or drink. For example, a can                                          opening system
         of self-heating food contains two chemicals, which are                                          seal for water and calcium

         in separate compartments. When you open the can,                                                water
         the two chemicals mix with each other and react. The                                            waterproof separator

         The chemicals used are calcium oxide and water. When
         the water and calcium oxide are mixed together they react,

         area, or in an emergency when there is no power, or
         when you are camping.



                                           PL
         The cans are expensive to produce because the
         compartments must be sealed from one another and from the food,
                                                                              place. Thermal energy is given out and transferred

         so that it does not become contaminated. There have also been problems
         with the food not being heated evenly.


         Using endothermic processes
         People sometimes use ice packs when they injure
                       M
         themselves. These packs are stored in a fridge or freezer
         until they are needed. When the ice pack is placed on the
         injured area, heat from this area is transferred to the ice
         pack and the ice melts. This is an endothermic process.
         not an endothermic reaction as no new substances are
         formed It means that the injured area is cooled and this

         often prevents it from swelling up. After it has been used,
         the ice pack can go back into the freezer to be used again.
                                                                                 A chemical icepack being used to treat an injury.
         Some ‘ice’ packs are made from substances that undergo
         an endothermic process when they mix together.
         These packs can be used even when you don’t have fridge or freezer.
         The pack has two compartments inside, each with a different substance.
         These are usually ammonium nitrate and water. When you push on the
         pack and break the compartment containing ammonium nitrate, the
         water mixes with it and the ammonium nitrate begins to dissolve. This is
         an endothermic process, so the temperature drops.

         8 Chemical reactions



         Looking at the reactions of metals
         with oxygen
         Many metals react with oxygen if they get hot enough. When you look
         carefully at the reactions of metals with oxygen, it is possible to identify
         which metals are more reactive. For example, magnesium is more
         reactive than iron because magnesium reacts more quickly than iron.
         This reaction between metals and oxygen is an oxidation reaction.
         Some metals react very quickly with oxygen without even being heated.

         When pieces of sodium, potassium or calcium are taken from their
         containers, they appear dull. When the pieces are cut, the surface is
         shiny. The shiny surface soon becomes dull because the metal reacts with
         the oxygen in the air. The surface becomes covered with a new substance
         – the oxide of the metal. These metals are so reactive that they have to




                                              PL
         be stored under oil to prevent them reacting. The layer of metal oxide on
         the surface prevents any more of the metal from reacting with the air or
         water vapour.

         A scientist cuts a piece of sodium metal with a scalpel.


         The general word equation for this reaction is:
                                  metal + oxygen               metal oxide
         Some metals, such as gold, do not react with oxygen. They are generally
         unreactive. They are described as inert.
         Silver reacts slowly with the air and if a silver object is not cleaned it
         goes black over time, as silver oxide is formed.

        The reaction between iron and oxygen
        When iron is left in damp air it rusts. The iron reacts with oxygen to

                                    iron + oxygen           iron oxide
        This is not a very useful reaction because it means that the iron changes




                                               PL
        and no longer has the same properties. A strong iron girder can become
        rusted and fall apart. This could mean that a building collapses.
        The reaction between iron and oxygen only takes place when both water
        and oxygen are present. The water is not part of the equation, but it is
        needed for the reaction to happen. The reaction takes a long time to
        happen – iron is not very reactive with oxygen.

         absorbs water so the air inside the tube is dry. The tube is stoppered.
         Test tube 4 has water that has been boiled to remove as much dissolved
         gas as possible. On top of the boiled water is a layer of oil. This stops
         any air entering the water. The tube is stoppered.

        In the equation above the (g) after water indicates it is water in the form
        of a gas, in this case steam. Steam is formed by boiling water and is very
        hot whereas water vapour is made up of water particles in the air at
        lower temperatures. Some metals, such as gold, do not react with water
        at all.

         8 Chemical reactions



         A familiar reaction
         You will probably remember the reaction of magnesium with dilute
         hydrochloric acid. This is the word equation for this reaction:
                 magnesium + hydrochloric acid                                            magnesium chloride + hydrogen
         Magnesium chloride is an example of a salt. When a metal reacts with
         an acid, the products are a salt and hydrogen.
         The general equation for this reaction is:

           Reactivity order
           On seperate sticky notes, write the name of each of the metals
           you used when carrying out the investigation into the reaction
           of metals in acid.
           Stick these on to the table in the order of reactivity, with the
           most reactive at the top. Use the information from the
           investigation above.




                                             E
           Compare your order with other groups. Are they the same
           or similar?
           Use the class results to make an order you all agree on.
           Does this order tie in with the results from the investigations of




                                           PL
           the reactions of metals with oxygen and water?
           Now write sticky notes for the metals you could not use (sodium,
           gold, silver, calcium and potassium) and fit those into your list.
           When you are happy with your order, make a poster to show your
           list and illustrate it with diagrams to show the various reactions
           with oxygen, water and/or dilute acids.
           Questions
           5	 Which was the most reactive of the metals you used?
                        M

         How did the three investigations help me to decide in which
         order to put the metals?


           Summary checklist
              	   I can describe the reactions of some metals with dilute acid.
              	   I can plan an investigation.

          Background
          Each day you make decisions about how to keep safe and minimise the risks that you




                                           PL
          take. It might be when you cross a street, when you make a hot drink, head a football,
          cook a meal or use a knife to cut vegetables. You probably don’t even realise you are
          doing it, but you are carrying out a risk assessment for most tasks.
          In the laboratory there are a number of hazardous situations and there are rules about
          how you should behave and what you should do to stay safe. In the picture above there
          are lots of things happening that are unsafe. People should never behave like that in a
          laboratory, so look carefully at the picture and identify as many things that are unsafe as
          you can.
          Your task
                       M
          You should be able to explain why a thing is unsafe. Work in a group of three or four and
          make a list, with reasons.
          Your main task is to provide guidance to learners starting the secondary science course, to
          help them keep safe. You could write a poem or a song that could be on every laboratory
          wall or in every child’s notebook; you could write a guide book; write and perform a short
SA

          play or make a poster that could be in every laboratory. You should try to come up with
          some original way of getting the safety message across.
          Your work will be shared with the whole class.

        The magnetic field
        A magnet is something that will attract magnetic
        materials. Magnetic materials include the metals iron,
        steel, nickel and cobalt. You will probably have used a
        magnet to attract paperclips.                                              The paperclips are made from steel, which is a
                                                                                   magnetic material.
        Magnets have two poles, north and south. They are
        shown with the letters N and S on diagrams.
        When a paperclip is close to one of the poles of a magnet, the paperclip




                                                E
        will be attracted to the magnet. As you move the paperclip further away,
        it stops being attracted.
        The paperclip is attracted to a magnet when it is in the magnetic field of
        that magnet.




                                              PL
        A magnetic field is the area around a magnet where the effects of the
        magnet can be detected.
        A magnetic field surrounds all magnets. The magnetic field of a magnet
        is strongest at the poles.




                 magnet                                                                   paperclip
                          M
        The paperclip is outside the magnetic field of this magnet, so will not be attracted.


        You can detect a magnetic field in two ways. You can see whether
        a magnetic object moves because of attraction. You can also use
        a compass. A compass contains a magnetised needle that is free
        to turn. The needle will turn and point in the direction of a
SA

        magnetic field. The picture shows a compass. Some mobile
        devices such as phones have compass apps.


        Magnetic field lines
        You can draw magnetic field lines around a magnet to represent
        the magnetic field.
        The rules are that
                                                                                                A compass can be used to detect a
        •    magnetic field lines join opposite poles                                           magnetic field.
        •    the magnetic field lines have arrows that point N  S
        •    magnetic field lines must not touch each other
        •    magnetic field lines must not cross each other.




                                                                                                                     293

         Following these rules, the magnetic field lines around a bar magnet look
         like this:




         and the magnetic field lines around a horseshoe magnet look like this:




                                             E
                                           PL
         You can tell by looking at magnetic field lines where the magnetic
         field is strongest. The magnetic field is strongest where the lines
         are closest together.
                       M
         If one magnet is stronger than another, the magnetic field of the
         stronger magnet will be different in two ways.
         •    All the field lines will be closer together.
         •    The field lines will extend further away from the magnet.

         direction a compass will point. When it is in a magnetic field, a                in the direction of the magnetic field
         compass will point in the direction of the lines.                                lines.

        Magnetic fields interacting
        You probably already know about the forces between two magnets.
        •    Two north poles repel.
        •    Two south poles repel.
        •    A north and a south pole attract.
        This force is due to the magnetic fields from each magnet.
        Look at the field lines between two magnets when their
        opposite poles are together.




                                             E
        The magnetic field lines between the two magnets are all
        pointing in the same direction. This means there will be a force of
        attraction between the magnets.
        Now look at the field lines between two magnets
        when their like poles are together.



                                           PL
        The magnetic field lines in the space directly between
        these two magnets are all pointing in opposite
        directions. This means the magnets will repel, or try
        to move away from each other.

           and other people will get the iron filings on their skin.


           1	 Cut a hole in the middle of the thick card, just
              large enough to put the bar magnet in.
           2	 Put the bar magnet into the hole so it lies flat
              in the card. The card is to support the paper
              and keep the paper level.
           3	 Put the paper on top of the card so the
                       M
              magnet is under the middle of the paper.
           4	 Gently and evenly sprinkle the iron filings
              over the paper. Tap the paper gently to allow
              the iron filings to move into position.
              You should see a pattern like the one in the picture.

         The Earth’s magnetic field
         Around 4000 years ago, a Greek shepherd called Magnes was looking after
         his sheep. The story of Magnes says that iron nails in his shoes stuck to
         one particular type of rock. The rock was called lodestone and contained
         a substance that was later named magnetite, which is a naturally occurring
         magnet. ‘Naturally occurring’ means it is not made by people.
         Both the Greeks and the Chinese started to investigate magnetic properties.
         The Chinese discovered that a small needle of lodestone,
         split off the rock, could be made to float on water. When




                                                E
         allowed to float, the needle of lodestone always turned to
         point in the same direction.
         One end of the needle pointed toward the north and the
         other end pointed toward the south. This was the invention
         of the magnetic compass.




                                              PL
         It was soon discovered that the compass needle pointed to
         a position close to the Earth’s north pole, but not exactly
         to the geographic north pole. This point is now called
         magnetic north. Magnetic north moves very slowly, and is
         currently in the Arctic Ocean, north of Alaska.
         The invention of the compass was very important because
         it allowed people to navigate in places such as oceans and
         deserts, with less chance of getting lost. With a compass,
         you will always know what direction you are facing.
                                                                        The first compasses, in 200 BCE, looked like this.
                        M
         Even today with satellite navigation (satnav), ships and
         aeroplanes still use magnetic compasses.
         Satellite navigation, or satnav, systems do not use the
         Earth’s magnetic field.
         Some animals, such as the birds in the photograph, use

        Notice, in the diagram, that the magnetic field lines around the Earth
        point towards the Earth’s north pole. You will remember from Topic 9.1
        that magnetic field lines point from north to south.
        This means that the north pole of Earth is actually a magnetic south pole!
        The term magnetic north, when used in context of the Earth and navigation
        means the magnetic pole that is close to the geographic north pole.
        In the same way, magnetic south is the magnetic pole that is close to the
        geographic south pole.
        The geographic north and south poles are the parts of the Earth




                                              E
        through which the spin axis passes.
        The Earth’s magnetic field causes the natural appearance of lights visible
        in the night sky close to the north and south poles. These are caused by
        particles coming from the Sun arriving into the stronger parts of the
        Earth’s magnetic field.

        The needle on this magnetic compass is pointing	      This natural light display is caused by the Earth’s magnetic field.
        towards the Earth’s magnetic north.	


        Origin of the Earth’s magnetic field
        People once thought that the Earth was made almost entirely from
        magnetic rocks. However, it is now known that the high temperatures deep
        inside the Earth would cause rocks to lose any magnetism that they had.
        Scientists also know that the Earth’s magnetic field has reversed in the
        past. The last change was around 500 000 years ago, when south really
        was north!

         9 Magnetism


         It is now known that the Earth’s core is the origin of the magnetic field,
         but scientists have still to discover the exact reason for this. They think
         the heat generated in the core, which is mostly made from iron, causes it
         to continually create a magnetic field. The core also contains some nickel,
         which is another magnetic metal. The movement in the liquid outer core
         would explain why the magnetic poles move slowly, and have occasionally
         reversed. Magnetic north moves at a speed of about 60 km per year.

         Airport runways are numbered according to their direction from magnetic north. The numbers sometimes have to be changed
         due to movement of magnetic north.

         9 Magnetism



         Properties of magnetic materials
         A material is described as magnetic if it is attracted to a magnet.
         Magnetic materials include the metals iron, nickel and cobalt. Steel
         is another common magnetic metal. Steel is a mixture that contains
         a large proportion of iron.
         Magnetic materials can be magnetised. Magnetised means turned into
         a magnet. The magnets you have used were all made by magnetising
         magnetic materials.
         The magnets you have used are called permanent magnets because




                                             E
         they have a magnetic field that is always there. You cannot switch the
         magnetic field off and on again.
         One way to magnetise a magnetic material is by using electricity.
         When this method is used, the magnet is called an electromagnet.

         Electromagnets


                                           PL
         An electromagnet is made by wrapping a wire around a
         magnetic material, such as iron. The wire that is wrapped
         around is a called a coil. The material in the middle of the
         coil is called the core.
         When current passes through the coil, the magnetic material
         becomes magnetised.
         When the current is switched off, the magnetic material loses
                                                                                           –

         The diagram shows the simplest type of electromagnet.

         Poles of an electromagnet
         An electromagnet has two poles, similar to a bar magnet.
SA

         You can find out which pole is which in two simple ways.
         •	   Use a magnetic compass. A magnetic compass points along
              magnetic field lines, so will point towards the south pole.
         •	   Use a bar magnet with known poles. Opposite poles attract
              and like poles repel so, by bringing the bar magnet close to the
              electromagnet, you can detect which pole is which.
         You can reverse the poles of an electromagnet in one of two ways.
         •	   Wrap the coil around in the opposite direction.
         •	   Reverse the connections on the cell or power supply.

         Applications of electromagnets
         Electromagnets are used in many applications where a permanent
         magnet would not be useful.

        Electromagnets can also be used for sorting scrap metal. The
        electromagnet will attract iron and steel, leaving other non-
        magnetic metals behind. Common non-magnetic metals include
        copper, aluminium and zinc. When the magnetic metals have
        been lifted, they can be moved away and then dropped by
        switching off the magnet.

        An electric bell uses an electromagnet to make the hammer move.
        When the electromagnet is on, the hammer is pulled onto the
        bell. The movement breaks the circuit and the hammer moves
        away from the bell. The circuit becomes complete again and the
        hammer is pulled back to the bell. This continues until the power
        supply is turned off. Electric bells are used in schools, as fire         The cover has been removed to show the

         •	   a coil of wire
         •	   a magnetic core inside the coil
         •	   an electric current flowing in the coil.
         These three things are the factors that will affect the strength of an
         electromagnet.
         •	   The number of turns in the coil. The more turns in the coil, the

         •	   The material of the core. Iron and some types of steel in the core
              make the strongest electromagnets.
         •	   The current in the coil. The greater the current, the stronger the
              electromagnet.

        Soft iron is not soft in the same way as modelling clay is soft. Soft
        iron is the term used for iron that is easily magnetised and also easily
        demagnetised. Demagnetised means it has lost its magnetism.
        In 2019, scientists broke the world record for the strongest electromagnet.
        They made an electromagnet 4500 times stronger than a school bar
        magnet. It uses more electricity than three million electric lamps!
        The strength of an electromagnet can be measured by the force that the
        electromagnet exerts on a magnetic material. The easiest way to do this is
        to see how many magnetic objects that the electromagnet can lift and hold.

         9 Magnetism



           Think like a scientist

           Investigating electromagnet strength
           In this activity, you will carry out investigations and plan further investigations
           on the strength of electromagnets.
           Work in groups of two or three.

              You will need:
              • three 1.5 V cells or an adjustable d.c. power supply with safety cut-out




                                             E
              • leads and connectors  • switch  • an ammeter  • iron nail 
              • paperclips of different sizes
              • plastic-coated wire at least 1 m long with about 1 cm of plastic removed from
                each end




           Safety
                                           PL
              • selection of similar-sized cores to the iron nail, such as a wooden pencil,
                 roll of paper, plastic pen and at least one other metal



           Only keep your electromagnet switched on for the shortest possible time,
           otherwise your cells will not last long.
           Check that the wire in the coil is not becoming hot. If the wire becomes hot,
           switch off immediately and tell your teacher.
                       M
           Method: Part 1 – changing the number of turns in the coil
           1	 Make an electromagnet. Use the number of cells or the power supply
              setting that your teacher advises. (You should recall how to make an
              electromagnet from Topic 9.3.)
                Use the iron nail for the core.
SA

                Wrap the wire around the core to make five turns.
           2	 Switch on the electromagnet and see how many paperclips it will hold.
              Record this result.
           3	 Switch the electromagnet off and increase the number of turns on the
              coil by five.
           4	 Switch on the electromagnet and see how many paperclips it will hold.
              Record this result.
           5	 Repeat steps 3–4 until you can’t fit any more turns on the core.
           6	 Repeat the entire investigation. If any of your results are different, you may
              need to repeat them a third time.

          Method: Part 2 – changing material in the core
          1	 Make an electromagnet. Use the iron nail as the core. Wrap the maximum
             number of turns in the coil that will fit on the core. Use the number of cells
             or the power supply setting that your teacher advises.

          2	 Switch on the electromagnet and see how many paperclips it will hold.
          3	 Repeat this with other core materials. The other cores should be about the
             same diameter, so you should not have to unwind the coil each time.
          4	 As in Method: Part 1, repeat each of your measurements.

          Method Part 3 – changing the current in the coil
          In this part, you will plan the investigation yourself.
          The aim of this part is to investigate how the current in the coil affects the
          strength of the electromagnet.
          1	 Decide which variable to change and how you will change it. Your teacher can help
              with this.
          2	 Decide which variables you will control.
          3	 Draw a circuit diagram for your electromagnet.
          4	 Make a prediction for your investigation.
          5	 Decide whether large or small paperclips will give better results.
             Explain your choice.
