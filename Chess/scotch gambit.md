# Chess Notes: The Scotch Gambit

**Opening:** Scotch Gambit
**ECO Codes:** C44, C45

## Overview

The Scotch Gambit is an aggressive variation arising from the Scotch Game. Instead of recapturing the pawn on $d4$ immediately, White sacrifices it (or delays its recapture) by playing $4. Bc4$, aiming for rapid development, central influence, and attacking chances, particularly against the $f7$ square. It often leads to open, tactical positions.

## Key Move Sequence

1.  $e4 \ e5$
2.  $Nf3 \ Nc6$
3.  $d4 \ exd4$
4.  $Bc4$

## Main Variations for Black

Black has several ways to respond to the gambit:

### 1. Classical Variation: $4...Bc5$

This is a solid and popular response, developing a piece and controlling key central squares.

* **Move:** $4...Bc5$
* **White's Options:**
    * **$5. c3$ (Göring Gambit):** White offers a second pawn for rapid development.
        * $5...dxc3$ (Göring Gambit Accepted): Leads to sharp play, e.g., $6. Nxc3$ or $6. Bxf7+!?$ followed by $Ng5+$.
        * $5...Nf6$: Declines the c-pawn, attacks $e4$. Often transposes to Giuoco Piano or Two Knights lines after $6. cxd4 \ Bb4+$.
        * $5...d3$: Blocks the pawn, less common.
    * **$5. O-O$:** Simple development.
        * $5...Nf6$: Transposes towards Max Lange Attack type positions after $6. e5$.
        * $5...d6$: Solid. White can play $6. c3$.
    * **$5. Ng5?!$**: Aggressive but potentially dubious if Black knows the defense ($5...Nh6!$ or $5...Ne5$). Targets $f7$.

### 2. Two Knights Variation: $4...Nf6$

Develops the knight and immediately attacks White's $e4$ pawn.

* **Move:** $4...Nf6$
* **White's Options:**
    * **$5. e5$ (Main Line):** Grabs space and attacks the knight.
        * $5...d5!$: Black counter-attacks the bishop. This leads to complex tactical lines, e.g., $6. Bb5 \ Ne4 \ 7. Nxd4 \ Bd7 \ 8. Bxc6 \ bxc6 \ 9. O-O$.
        * $5...Ng4$: A less common but tricky move. White can play $6. O-O$ or sometimes the sharp sacrifice $6. Bxf7+!?$ (e.g., $6...Kxf7 \ 7. Ng5+$).
    * **$5. O-O$:** Castles.
        * $5...Nxe4$: Black accepts the pawn sacrifice. Can lead to sharp lines like the **Haxo Gambit** after $6. Re1 \ d5 \ 7. Bxd5 \ Qxd5 \ 8. Nc3$.
        * $5...Bc5$: Transposes back to the $4...Bc5 \ 5. O-O \ Nf6$ line.
    * **$5. Ng5?!$**: Again targets $f7$, often met by $5...d5 \ 6. exd5 \ Ne5!$.

### 3. Intermezzo Check: $4...Bb4+$

Black checks before deciding how to proceed.

* **Move:** $4...Bb4+$
* **White's Options:**
    * **$5. c3$:** White ignores the check and offers another pawn, aiming for quick development after $5...dxc3$.
        * $5...dxc3 \ 6. O-O$ (Gambit continues)
        * $5...dxc3 \ 6. bxc3 \ Bc5$ (or $Ba5$)
    * **$5. Nc3$:** Blocks the check and develops. Can transpose, e.g., $5...Nf6 \ 6. O-O$.

### 4. Other Defenses: $4...Be7$

* **Move:** $4...Be7$
* **Description:** More passive but solid. White typically continues with development ($O-O$, $c3$). Less challenging to White's aims than other lines.

## Strategic Ideas for White

* **Rapid Development:** Get pieces out quickly (Bishops, Knights, Castle early).
* **Initiative:** Control the flow of the game, create threats, force Black to react.
* **Attack on f7:** The $Bc4$ directly eyes the weak $f7$ pawn. Often combined with $Ng5$ or sacrifices.
* **Open Lines:** Use the open $d$-file and potentially the $e$ or $f$-files for rooks.
* **Central Control:** Fight for the center, often using pawn levers like $c3$ followed by $d4$ (if applicable) or $e5$.
* **Exploit Black's King Safety:** If Black delays castling or gets greedy, White can often launch a quick attack.

## Strategic Ideas for Black

* **Consolidate:** If accepting the pawn(s), try to complete development and safeguard the king.
* **Neutralize White's Initiative:** Exchange active pieces, counter-attack (especially in the center with ...$d5$).
* **Develop Quickly:** Avoid falling too far behind in development.
* **Target White's Weaknesses:** The $e4$ pawn can become a target. White's structure might be compromised after pawn sacrifices.
* **Exploit Material Advantage:** If Black survives the opening onslaught with an extra pawn, aim for a favorable endgame.

## Common Traps and Tactics

* Sacrifices on $f7$ ($Bxf7+$ or $Nxf7$).
* Tactics involving $Ng5$ hitting $f7$.
* Discovered attacks after moves like $e5$.
* Pins along the $e$-file if Black plays $...Nxe4$ carelessly.
* In lines with $c3$ and $...dxc3$, tactics involving $Qb3$ hitting $f7$ and $b7$.
