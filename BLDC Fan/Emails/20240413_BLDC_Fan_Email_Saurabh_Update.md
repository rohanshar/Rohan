Subject: Re: Following Up: BLDC Fan Update from Amit

Sir,

Amit was out of town last week, which is why he couldn't provide the update by April 8th as initially planned. He will be back on Wednesday (16th april) with the BLDC fan sample. I will keep you informed as soon as I have more information from him.

Regards,
