Hi Saurabh,

Regarding the BLDC fan project, I wanted to check in on the update
from Amit. Have you heard back from him?

Could you please let me know if we should expect anything further from
that direction, or if you think we should start exploring other
options?

What's your opinion on the best way forward?

Thanks,
Rohan
