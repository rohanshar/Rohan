### Subject: Urgent: New Direction for BLDC Fan Project - Vendor Search

Hi Team (Arun Jha, Saurabh, Arun Sharma),

Given the continued delays and uncertainty regarding Amit's BLDC fan solution, we need to urgently explore alternative paths. While we will have a final check-in with Amit, we cannot solely rely on this option anymore.

**Action Items:**

*   **Saurabh:** Please arrange a meeting with Amit for this Wednesday, April 16th. The goal is to get a definitive answer on the status and viability of his sample/solution.
*   **Arun Sharma & Arun Jha:** Please collaborate and begin an urgent search for potential vendors who can supply suitable off-the-shelf BLDC fan designs or complete units. We need to identify viable alternatives as quickly as possible. Please provide an initial list of potential vendors by the end of this week.
*   **Arun Jha:** Please also continue pursuing the components you were initially tasked with sourcing.

Let's regroup early next week to discuss findings from the vendor search and the outcome of the meeting with Amit.

Thanks,

Rohan
