Sir,

I'm following up on Amit's progress from last week's discussion. Although he doesn't have a ready-made solution at the moment, he is actively working on it.

He mentioned that he would provide us with a clear update on his progress by tomorrow evening, so we'll know more then. If his solution doesn't seem viable at that point, we can definitely explore other options.


Regards,

Saurabh Singh
