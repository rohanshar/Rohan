Subject: BLDC Fan Project - Status Update & Next Steps

To: Saurabh, Arun Sharma
Cc: Arun Jha

Hi Team,

Hope you're both doing well.

This email is to check in on the BLDC Fan project status and plan our next steps.

**Saurabh:**
*   I understand you are scheduled to meet with Amit today (April 23rd) to evaluate the sample he is providing.
*   During the meeting, could you please focus on evaluating the following:
    *   **Functionality & Performance:** Does the sample meet our technical requirements?
    *   **Build Quality:** Assess the physical construction and materials.
    *   **Production Capability:** Discuss Amit's capacity, timelines, and reliability for potential bulk production.
    *   **Pricing:** Confirm the pricing structure.
*   Please report back with your findings and assessment after the meeting.

**Arun Sharma & Arun Jha:**
*   Could you please provide an update on the urgent search for alternative vendors? Have any promising options been identified, and what's the status of compiling the initial list?

Based on the outcome of Saurabh's meeting with Amit and the progress on the alternative vendor search, we'll need to discuss realigning our immediate focus. We can decide whether to prioritize moving forward with Amit or shift focus to exploring the alternatives more deeply.

Could we aim for a brief call later this week or early next week, once we have updates from both fronts, to decide on the best path forward?

Please let me know the latest updates from the vendor search, and Saurabh, please share your assessment after meeting Amit.

Thanks,

Rohan
